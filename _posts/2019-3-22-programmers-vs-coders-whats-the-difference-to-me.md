So you might have clicked on this article because you are curious. You are curious to know why someone would differentiate a programmer from a coder. You might be thinking “well aren’t they the same thing?” A lot of people do think they are. However in my eyes I see a big difference between a programmer and a coder. Let me explain.

所以，你也许是在好奇心的驱使下，点开今天的推送的。是啊，你可能会想，程序员不就是写代码的吗，哪个程序员不是“码农”？这怎么可能有区别嘛！

没错，很多人都是这么认为的。然而，在我看来，程序员和写代码的“码农”之间其实判若云泥，有着巨大的差异。

不相信？那让我跟你解释解释。

## 什么样的人是“写代码的”

Firstly let me define what a coder is to me. To me a coder is a specialist at, yeah you guessed it, coding. They generally have their own choice of language they know really well. They know it so well that they can almost tell you exactly the ins and outs of how that language works. They know all the available libraries that exist, and how to incorporate them all quickly to build something useful. They are usually seen as high performers to upper management, because they simply “get stuff done”. You can throw programming tasks at them, and they will churn out the code needed to build whatever feature you have in no time.

首先，请允许我定义一下我认为的“码农”是什么样的。

对我来说，“码农”是一类专精于——是的，你猜对了——写代码的人。他们通常掌握一门或几门编程语言。他们对所掌握的语言非常熟悉，几乎可以准确地告诉你这种语言工作运行的所有细节。他们对所有可用的库都了如指掌，也知道如何快速合并它们以构建出有用的东西。在高层管理人员眼中，他们属于效率超群的精英，因为他们总能简单地把工作**“搞定”**了。你可以把编程任务丢给他们，他们转眼之间就能把代码弄出来，构建出你想要的任何功能。

Sounds great yeah? Well sure. Coders can serve a purpose in your projects, however there is more to software, than just churning out code and putting it on a server to run (or client depending on what you are doing).

听起来“码农”很牛x啊？当然是的。在项目开发过程中，他们有着举足轻重的地位。

但是在软件工程方面，可不仅仅是弄出代码，将其放在服务器上运行或者打包成客户端（具体取决于项目目标）就完事了。

In my eyes a coder generally does not see the bigger picture, nor do they care to. They do not care about solving business problems with proper UX. They do not care about system architecture. They don’t concern themselves with what server their code is running on. They are not fussed about availability, scalability, durability, resiliency, delivery, management and so on. In regards to performance they only concern themselves with checking their own code. Basically all they care about is writing code, making sure there are some unit tests around that code, and being able to say they have good test coverage. They will then make a pull request for their code to be merged. End of story.

在我看来，“码农”们通常看不到、也不关心全局层面的东西。他们不关心用适当的**用户体验**来解决业务问题，不关心系统架构，不用费心了解运行其代码的服务器。对可用性、可扩展性、持久性、容错性，交付方式，项目管理等方面也不太在意。在性能方面，他们只关心自己的代码是不是足够优化了。

基本上他们所关心的只是**编写代码**本身，围绕代码进行一些单元测试，确保覆盖到绝大多数可能出现的问题。然后，他们将代码提交上去，申请一个 Pull Request 合并到分支里，就完事了。

Now even though it sounds like it, I’m not having a go at coders. Having a handful of people who just code can be good for business. But a coder is not a programmer and programmers also have a special purpose.

说到这里，可能你会觉得我简直是吹毛求疵。然而我并不是对辛勤写代码的“码农”们有什么意见，毕竟在业务上，有一些专注于编写代码的员工还是颇有助益的。<span class="hl">但只写代码的并不能算是程序员，程序员还有一些特殊的“用途”。</span>

## 什么样的人是“程序员”

So what do I consider a programmer? Well first and foremost a programmer to me solves problems. They generally analyse all options to a technical problem, looking for the most appropriate solution to that problem. This process starts long before they even touch a keyboard to write even one line of code. Each solution they come up with to a problem is assessed by not only themselves, but potentially a handful of other programmers as well.

那么我认为的程序员是什么样的呢？

首先，也是对我来说最重要的特质在于，程序员能解决问题。他们通常会分析某个技术问题所有可能的选项，以找到最合适的解决方案。在他们甚至还没碰到键盘，连一行代码都没开始打之前，这个过程就已经开始了。不仅如此，他们针对问题提出的每个解决方案也不仅由他们自己评估，而且还可能由若干名其他程序员共同参与评估。

Programmers do concern themselves with how their solution will work in regards to UX. They will consider how the system architecture will work for their solution. They will also think about how it will be delivered, maintained, and supported going forward. They think clearly about how many servers (or docker containers) they will need, how they are orchestrated, how deploying to these cluster of servers will be performed etc. They do concern themselves with availability, scalability, durability, resiliency etc. They generally are more versed in good design patterns, both code based and architectural ones. Designing the architecture and delivery pipeline needed to get their solution all the way to production is of upmost importance to them. Only when all these things are addressed do they sit down to write code.

程序员确实关心他们的解决方案的**用户体验**情况。他们将考虑系统架构在解决方案中起到的作用。他们还会思考未来在交付、维护和支持方面的做法。他们清楚地考虑过需要的服务器（或 docker 容器）数量，如何编配它们，如何将代码部署到服务器集群等等。他们确实关注可用性、可扩展性、持久性、容错性等。他们通常都精通各种包括基于代码、基于架构的优秀设计模式。

<img src="/img/20190322/003.jpg" />

对他们来说，至关重要的是<span class="hl">要设计好从架构到部署渠道等一系列问题，保证作为解决方案的代码能从设计到部署一路畅通</span>。只有解决了所有这些问题后，他们才会真正坐下来，写代码。

Unlike coders, programmers generally are not as fast at writing code, and this makes sense. They invest more of their time into other areas of software delivery. This does not mean they can’t write code. They can and regularly do, it’s just not at the same pace a coder can.

与“码农”不同，真正的程序员通常没有办法超级快速地写代码，这是有道理的。他们将更多时间投入到软件部署等其他领域。这并不意味着他们在写代码方面有什么问题。他们可以而且经常这样做，只不过和“码农”的速度不一样。

Programmers are generally not seen instantly as “high performers” by upper management, but generally their peers value their time and effort more, and eventually upper management does take notice.

高层管理人员通常不会马上就把程序员视为“高效”的化身，但通常他们的同行会更重视他们所花费的时间和精力，而且管理层最终也肯定会注意到这点。

## 你的看法又是如何呢？

So you are probably wondering, which one do I prefer at my company? A coder or a programmer? Based on reading this a lot of you are probably saying I would think a programmer. But honestly I think you need both. You need people that can think their way through problems and assess all outcomes like a programmer does, but at the same time to gain fast throughput once those decisions are made, having some speedy coders on hand, can be very valuable.

那么，你觉得自己喜欢做哪一种人？单纯的“码农”还是程序员？

看了上面我说的这些东西，你们可能会觉得，我更偏爱程序员吧。

但老实说，对一个成熟的项目来说，两者都是非常重要的。一方面，你需要那些可以思考问题的解决方案，并评估所有结果的人，就像上面说的程序员；但同时，为了获得较高的开发速度，一旦完成这些技术决策，手头有一些快速的精英“码农”为项目服务，就相当重要了。

In conclusion, in my personal opinion coders and programmers are not the same thing, however they do compliment each other really well.

总之，在我个人看来，“码农”和程序员并不是一回事，但他们确实各有所长，也十分互相尊重。

最后，你的看法又是如何呢？欢迎留言分享！
