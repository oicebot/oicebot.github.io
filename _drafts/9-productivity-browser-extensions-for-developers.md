作为 Web 开发者，网页浏览器可以说是吃饭的工具啦。如今，现代的浏览器都带有丰富的扩展插件，我们可以充分利用它们，让工作环境更加便捷，提高工作效率，简化工作流程。

We’re approaching 2020, and many new extensions have popped up. I’ve decided to gather the most useful extensions for web developers and put them in a list.

Daily 2.0</small>

Every single day, new and updated software development technologies are being released across the internet. For us as developers, staying updated is a huge hassle. Daily was made by developers for developers to help us focus on code instead of constantly searching for development news around the web.

## No Coin
There are websites out there that force our CPUs to mine cryptocurrencies for them. No Coin is a tiny browser extension aiming to block coin miners, such as Coinhive, who are using your computer resources without your consent.

JSON Formatter adds a page action to pretty-print JSON. Unlike similar extensions, this simply pretty-prints it. It doesn’t add any kind of viewer, colors, or collapsing.
### Install guide

Firefox extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/basic-json-formatter/

## Pomodoro Timer

<img src="/img/20190825/007.jpg"><br><small>

Pomodoro Timer extension

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method. There are six steps in the original technique:
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (three to five minutes), and then go to step two.
6. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, and then go to step one.

I’m using Pomodoro as you read this. Pomodoro is a practical way of getting things done, and it helps you learn how to focus and manage your time. If you’re curious to learn more about how to focus, this book was helpful to me.

### Install guide
Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef?hl=en
Firefox extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tomato-clock/

## Meta SEO Inspector
This extension is useful for inspecting the metadata found inside webpages that’s usually not visible while browsing.

Inspect your meta tags to ensure a good SEO score


This extension is mainly aimed at web developers that need to verify the HTML of their site to follow the Webmasters’ Google Guidelines, but it’s also useful for anyone who wants to see page content that’s not usually visible.

Alerts are shown when the metadata is not within certain ranges — for example when the description tag is too short or too long.

SEO is a language of its own. I suggest reading through “3 Months to No.1: The 2019 “No-Nonsense” SEO Playbook for Getting Your Website Found on Google” for best practices and tips for SEO.

### Install guide
Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-seo-inspector/ibkclpciafdglkjkcibmohobjkcfkaef?hl=en
Firefox extension https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/seo-inspector/
