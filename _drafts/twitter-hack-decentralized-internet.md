Kanye West, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Barack Obama were all feeling generous on the evening of July 16, according to their Twitter accounts, which offered to double any payments sent to them in bitcoin. Not really, of course; they’d been hacked. Or, rather, Twitter itself had been hacked, and for apparently stupid reasons: The perpetrators stole and resold Twitter accounts and impersonated high-follower users to try to scam people out of cryptocurrency.

7月16日晚上，坎耶·韦斯特（Kanye West）、伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）、比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）以及巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）都大发善心，在他们的推特（Twitter）帐号上公开声称会双倍返还汇给他们的比特币。这当然不是真的，他们的帐号被黑了。或者换句话说，是推特本身被黑了：犯罪份子盗窃并出售推特帐号，伪装成网红用户，尝试骗取别人的加密数字货币。

“The attack was not the work of a single country like Russia,” Nathaniel Popper and Kate Conger reported at _The New York Times_. “Instead, it was done by a group of young people … who got to know one another because of their obsession with owning early or unusual screen names.” The hackers gained access to Twitter’s tools and network via a “coordinated social engineering attack,” as Twitter’s customer-support account called it—a fancy way of admitting that their employees got played. All told, 130 accounts were compromised. “We feel terrible about the security incident,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said last week, in prepared remarks on an earnings call.

“攻击并不是由某一个国家所为，比如俄罗斯，”《纽约时报》记者纳撒尼尔·波普尔（Nathaniel Popper）和凯特·康格（Kate Conger）报道，“相反，这是一群年轻人干的……他们痴迷于拥有古老或不同寻常的网名，并因此结识。”攻击者连进了推特的网络并获取了工具，他们使用的手段叫做“协调一致的社会工程学攻击”——推特的客户支持帐号就是这么描述的，用这种方式承认自己的员工被耍了还真是别致。合计有 130 个帐号被侵入。“我们对此次安全事件表示非常难过，”推特总裁杰克·多尔西（Jack Dorsey）上周在财务电话会议上准备的发言如是说。

The hack makes Twitter look incompetent, and at a bad time; its advertising revenues are falling, and the company is scrambling to respond. It also underscores the impoverished cybersecurity at tech firms, which provide some employees with nearly limitless control over user accounts and data—as many as 1,000 Twitter employees reportedly had access to the internal tools that were compromised.

But the stakes are higher, too. Though much smaller than Facebook in terms of its sheer number of users, Twitter is where real-time information gets published online, especially on news and politics, from a small number of power users. That makes the service’s vulnerability particularly worrisome; it has become an infrastructure for live information. The information itself had already become weaponized; now it’s clear how easily the actual accounts publishing that information can be compromised too. 

That’s a terrifying prospect, especially in the lead-up to the November U.S. presidential election featuring an incumbent who uses Twitter obsessively, and dangerously. It should sound the internet equivalent of civil-defense sirens.

此次攻击使推特显得无能为力，且身陷困境；它的广告营收正在缩水，而公司则在仓促应对。这也凸显出科技公司在网络安全方面的贫弱，他们的一些员工拥有对用户账户和数据几乎无限制的控制权——据报道，能够接触被入侵的内部工具的员工，在推特达1000名之多。

但这其中包含着巨大的利益。虽然总用户数量比 Facebook 小，但推特是一个实时信息——特别是来自少数头部用户的新闻和时政类信息——的发布平台。而这也使得推特成为即时信息的基础设施。信息本身已经成为一种武器；现在很明显的是，发布这些信息的帐号本身也很容易被入侵。

这将导致可怕的后果，特别是在11月美国总统竞选准备过程中，现任总统痴迷地、危险地使用推特。是该拉响互联网的安防警报了。

Like many “verified” Twitter users who compose its obsessive elite, I was briefly unable to tweet as the hack played out, Twitter having taken extreme measures to try to quell the chaos. I updated my password, a seemingly reasonable thing to do amid a security breach. Panicked, Twitter would end up locking accounts that had attempted to change their password in the past 30 days. A handful of my Atlantic colleagues had done the same and were similarly frozen out. We didn’t know that at the time, however, and the ambiguity brought delusions of grandeur (Am I worthy of hacking?) and persecution (My Twitterrrrrr!). After less than a day, most of us got our accounts back, albeit not without the help of one of our editors, who contacted Twitter on our behalf.

就像许多痴迷发推的加“V”精英用户一样，在闹黑客的过程中我也有一段时间无法发推。推特采用了极端手段试图平息这场混乱。我做了一件在安全事故发生时看起来很合理的事：我修改了我的密码。然而，惊慌失措的推特最后把近30天内试图修改密码的帐号统统给锁了。我在《大西洋》杂志的一些同事也做了同样的事情，并也被冻结了账户。我们当时还不知道发生了什么，这些模糊的猜测也给带来了从骄傲（我已经红到会被黑客盯上了吗？）到烦忧（我的帐号啊啊啊啊啊！）的各种妄想。好在不到一天我们就拿回了自己的帐号，这都多亏了我们的一个编辑，他代表我们与推特官方进行了联系。

The whole situation underscores how centralized the internet has become: According to the _Times_ report, one hacker secured entry into a Slack channel. There, they found credentials to access Twitter’s internal tools, which they used to hijack and resell accounts with desirable usernames, before posting messages on high-follower accounts in an attempt to defraud bystanders. At The Atlantic, those of us caught in the crossfire were able to quickly regain access to the service only because we work for a big media company with a direct line to Twitter personnel. The internet was once an agora for the many, but those days are long gone, even if everyone can tweet whatever they want all the time.

整个情况凸显出互联网已经变得多么中心化：据《泰晤士报》报道，有一名黑客获得了某个 Slack 频道的访问权限，在那里，他们找到了取得推特内部工具所需的凭据，并用这工具入侵了指定名称的账户，将这些账号转卖出去，最后这些粉丝数众多的账户就被用来发送诈骗信息，试图欺骗关注他们的人。幸好《大西洋》是一家大型的媒体公司，而且和推特的工作人员有直接联系，所以我们这些被攻防交锋所波及的同事才能较快地重新访问推特服务。互联网曾经是为大多数人开设的市集，但那些日子早已一去不复返，即使每个人都一直能在推特上发布任何内容。

It’s ironic that centralization would overtake online services, because the internet was invented to decentralize communications networks—specifically to allow such infrastructure to survive nuclear attack.

在线服务被中心化所征服，是一件很讽刺的事。因为互联网本身特意被设计为去中心化的网络，以使这种基础设施能在核武器攻击下幸存。

In the early 1960s, the commercial telephone network and the military command-and-control network were at risk. Both used central switching facilities that routed communications to their destinations, kind of like airport hubs. If one or two of those facilities were to be lost to enemy attack, the whole system would collapse. In 1962, Paul Baran, a researcher at RAND, had imagined a possible solution: a network of many automated nodes that would replace the central switches, distributing their responsibility throughout the network.

在 1960 年代初，商业电话网络和军事指挥网络都面临着风险。它们都使用中心交换设施将通讯联通至对应的目的地，就像是空港一样。如果一两座这样的设施被敌方攻击摧毁，整个系统都将崩溃。在 1962 年，兰德公司（RAND）的研究员保罗·巴兰（Paul Baran）设想了一个可行的解决方案：用一个由许多自动节点构成的网络来取代中心交换设施，将数据交换的职能分布于整个网络之中。

The following year, J. C. R. Licklider, a computer scientist at the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), conceived of an Intergalactic Computer Network that might allow all computers, and thereby all the people using them, to connect as one. By 1969, Licklider’s successors had built an operational network after Baran’s conceptual design. Originally called the ARPANet, it would evolve into the internet, the now-humdrum infrastructure you are using to read this article.

第二年，美国国防部高级研究计划局（ARPA）的计算机科学家约瑟夫·利克莱德（J. C. R. Licklider）构思了一个“星际计算机网络”（Intergalactic Computer Network），它能将所有的计算机都连接在一起，从而让所有的用户互相通讯。到 1969 年，利克莱德的继任者们已经依照巴兰的设计构建出一个可运行的网络。这个网络被称为阿帕网（ARPANet），后来发展为如今已司空见惯的基础设施——也就是你正用来看这篇文章的互联网。

Over the years, the internet’s decentralized design became a metaphor for its social and political ethos: Anyone could publish information of any kind, to anyone in the world, without the assent of central gatekeepers such as publishers and media networks. Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web became the most successful interpretation of this ethos. Whether a goth-rock zine, a sex-toy business, a Rainbow Brite fan community, or anything else, you could publish it to the world on the web.

多年以来，互联网的分布式设计已经成为其社会与政治精神的隐喻：每个人都可以向世界上的任何人发表任何类型的信息，无需经过某个中心管理机构（比如出版商或媒体网络）的首肯。蒂姆·伯纳斯-李（Tim Berners-Lee）的万维网系统成为了这一精神最成功的注解：不论是哥特音乐杂志、成人玩具销售、《彩虹仙子》粉丝社群或其他什么东西，都可以被发布在网络上让全世界看到。

For a time, the infrastructural decentralization of the web matched that of its content and operations. Many people published to servers hosted at local providers; most folks still dialed up back then, and local phone calls were free. But as e-commerce and brochureware evolved into blogs, a problem arose: distributed publishing still required a lot of specialized expertise. You had to know how to connect to servers, upload files, write markup and maybe some code, and so on. Those capacities were always rarefied.

在一段时期内，网络的去中心化基础结构与它的内容和运作都相吻合。许多人都在当地提供商的服务器上发布信息，在大多数人还使用拨号上网的当时，本地电话是免费的。但随着电子商务和门户网站的兴起，问题出现了：分布式发布还需要许多专业知识。你需要直到如何连接到服务器，上传文件，编写 HTML 标记，或许还得写一些代码等等。这些能力总是不常见的。

So the centralization began. Blogs, which once required installing software on your own server, became household services such as Blogger, Typepad, WordPress, and Tumblr. Social-media services—Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and the rest—vied for user acquisition, mostly to build advertising-sales businesses to target their massive audiences. The services began designing for compulsion, because more attention makes advertising more valuable. Connections, such as friends on Facebook, followers on Twitter, colleagues on LinkedIn, all became attached to those platforms rather than owned by individuals, and earlier efforts to decentralize those relationships effectively vanished. Even email, once local to ISPs or employers, became centralized in services such as Hotmail and Gmail.

这也就是中心化的开始。需要你自己在服务器上安装软件架设的个人博客，已经被家家户户都能使用的网络服务（如 Blogger、Typepad、WordPress 和 Tumblr 等）所取代。社交媒体服务（如 Facebook、推特、Instagram、Snapchat、抖音等）正竞相争取用户，主要为了针对大量用户建立广告销售业务。关注的人越多，广告的价值就越高，于是这些服务被设计得越来越强制性。类似 Facebook 上的好友、推特上的粉丝、领英（LinkedIn）上的同事这样的“社会关系”全都变成与平台相关，而不是由用户个人所有。早期要将这些人际关系去中心化的尝试最终荡然无存。甚至电子邮件这种曾经由互联网提供商（ISP）或雇主企业提供的本地服务，也已经变成了中心化的邮件服务，比如 Hotmail 和 Gmail。

In the process, people and the materials they create became the pawns of technology giants. Some of the blog platforms were acquired by larger tech companies (Blogger by Google, Tumblr by Yahoo), and with those roll-ups came more of the gatekeeping (especially for sexually explicit material) that decentralization had supposedly erased. One of the most urgent questions in today’s information wars surrounds how—not whether—Facebook should act as a gatekeeper of content across its massive, centralized global network. “Content,” in fact, might be the most instructive fossil of this age, a term that now describes anything people make online, including the how-to videos of amateur crafters, the articles that journalists write, and policy pronouncements by world leaders. Whereas one might have once been a writer or a photographer or even a pornographer, now publishing is a process of filling the empty, preformed vessels provided by giant corporations. A thousand flowers still bloom on this global network, but all of them rely on, and return spoils to, a handful of nodes, just as communications systems did before the ARPAnet.

在这个过程中，用户以及用户创造的材料变成了科技巨头的棋子。一些博客平台被更大的科技企业收购（如 Google 收购了 Blogger，Yahoo 收购了 Tumblr），而随之而来的则是更多的内容控制（特别是对色情内容），这原本是去中心化所希望消除的。如今信息战场上最紧急的问题之一，就是 Facebook 该如何（而不是该不该）审查管理来自它巨大中心化网络中的各种内容。“内容”这个词已经成为我们这个时代最有代表性的化石，如今它被用来描述人们在网上生成的任何东西——包括业余手工爱好者的指南视频，记者写的文章，政客们发布的政策公告等等。曾经你需要成为一名作家、摄影师甚至春宫画家才能发表点东西，而如今“发表”不过就是科技巨头给你准备了一个空白的预制输入框，你把它填满的过程。环球网络上依旧万花齐放，但它们都依赖于（也滋养着）少数几个节点，就像在阿帕网出现之前的通讯系统一样。

Nuclear war is less of a threat than it was in 1963, but the risks of centralized communications systems have persisted and even worsened. By contrast, centralized online services such as Twitter and Facebook have become vectors for disinformation and conspiracy, conditions that have altered democracy, perhaps forever. A global, decentralized network promised to connect everyone, as its proponents had dreamed it would. But those connections made the network itself dangerous, in a way Licklider and others hadn’t anticipated.

如今核战的威胁已不像 1963 年那么紧张，但中心化通讯系统的风险不但依旧存在，甚至更加恶化。相比之下，中心化的在线服务（例如推特和 Facebook）已经变成了虚假信息和阴谋的载体，这些情况恐怕已经永远地改变了民主。一个全球化的、去中心化的网络承诺将所有人联系在一起，正如它的提出者所梦想的那样。但这样的联系已经使网络自身变得危险，这是利克莱德和其他人所未预见到的。

The cybersecurity implications of this sort of centralization are deeply unnerving. With titans of business, popular celebrities, and world leaders all using (and sometimes abusing) Twitter and other services, the ability to centrally attack and control any or all of those accounts—Taylor Swift’s or Donald Trump’s—could wreak far more havoc than a day of bitcoin fraud. What if businesses or elections were targeted instead?

这种中心化带来的网络安全后果令人深感不安。随着商业巨头、社会名流甚至国家领导人都在使用（甚至有时滥用）推特和其他网络服务，集中攻击并控制任意甚至所有账户的能力——比如泰勒·斯威夫特或唐纳德·特朗普的账户——可造成比一天的比特币骗局大得多的破坏。要是攻击目标变成商业或是选举呢？

The fact that the Twitter hack _wasn't_ consequential further alienates the public from the risks of centralization in information infrastructure. Most Twitter users probably didn’t even notice the drama. As far as we know, the few who were hacked suffered limited ill effects. And the low-grade power users, like me, who were caught in the crossfire either got their account back and carried on as before or didn’t (yet) and amount to uncounted casualties of centralized communications.

此次推特黑客事件_并没有_造成严重后果，这一事实进一步疏远了公众对信息基础设施集中化风险的认识。大部分推特用户可能甚至根本没有注意到这场闹剧。据我们所知，被黑客攻击的少数人只受到了有限的不良影响。而像我这样被卷入其中的低端用户，有的拿回了自己的账户并继续像往常一样，也有的还（暂时）没能拿回账户，而成为中心化通讯系统无数受害者之一。

One of those casualties is another of my Atlantic colleagues, Ellen Cushing. She had been on the outs with Twitter for some time, she told me, and just decided not to bother regaining control of her account. Instead, she’s rekindled an interest in media-outlet homepages. But already, Cushing has realized what she’s missing: the view of what’s happening now that Twitter uniquely offers. Twitter got its wish of becoming the place people go for real-time updates on news. But that also means that when it fails, as it did during this screen-name hack, part of our communications infrastructure also fails. Twitter isn’t just a place for memes or news, or even presidential press releases meted out in little chunks. It’s where the weather service and the bank and your kid’s school go to share moment-to-moment updates. Though seemingly inessential, it has braided itself into contemporary life in a way that also makes it vital.

其中一个受害者艾伦·库欣（Ellen Cushing），是我在《大西洋》的另外一个同事。她告诉我，她早就对推特不满了，这次决定不再费力气去取回她的账户。相反，她重燃了对媒体机构门户页面的兴趣。但库欣已经意识到她错过了什么：只有推特才能提供的关于现在正发生着的事情的观点。推特实现了它的愿望，成为人们跟进获取实时新闻的地方。但这也意味着，当推特出现故障时——比如这次账号被黑事件——我们也将失去一部分的通讯基础设施。推特不仅是传播梗图和新闻，甚至也不仅是发送碎片化的总统新闻稿的地方。它成为了气象服务、银行信息、你孩子的学校等分享即时更新信息的场所。虽然看似无足轻重，但它却将自己编入了当代生活之中，以这种方式让自己也变得至关重要。

That leaves us with a worst-of-all-worlds situation. The physical and logical infrastructure that helped communications networks avoid catastrophic failure has devolved back into a command-and-control model. At the same time, public reliance on those networks has deepened and intensified. Together, Facebook (which owns Instagram and WhatsApp), Google (which includes YouTube), Twitter, and Snap are worth a combined $1.7 trillion. In China, where Western services are banned, WeChat, Weibo, and Qzone count roughly 2 billion users among them. The drive to “scale” technology businesses has consolidated their wealth and power, but it has also increased their exposure. Bad actors target Facebook and Twitter for disinformation precisely because those services can facilitate its widespread dissemination. In retrospect, Licklider’s Intergalactic Computer Network should have sounded like an alien threat from the start.

这就使我们面临着糟得不能再糟的局面。帮助通信网络避免灾难性故障的物理和逻辑基础设施又下沉回了最初的命令与指挥模式。与此同时，公众对这些网络的依赖也不断加深、加强。Facebook（拥有 Instagram 和 Whatsapp）、Google（拥有 Youtube）、推特以及 Snap 加在一起总市值达1.7万亿美元。在中国微信、微博和 QQ 空间的用户数量合计也达到约 20 亿之多。驱动科技企业“规模化”的力量也保证了它们的财富与权力，但同时也增加了它们暴露在攻击之下的风险。坏人之所以针对 Facebook 和推特进行宣传，正是因为这些服务能促进内容的广泛传播。回想起来，利克莱德的“星际计算机网络”从一开始就听起来像个外星人危机。

But even after years of breaches and threats on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and beyond, tech can’t shake its obsession with centralization. The Facebook and Palantir Technologies investor Peter Thiel has exalted monopoly as the apotheosis of business. Content-creation start-ups enter the market not to break the grip of Google or Facebook, but in hopes of being acquired and rolled up into them. New social networks, such as TikTok, capture novel attention among younger audiences who find Facebook unappealing, but they still operate from the same playbook: Capture as many users as possible on a single platform in order to monetize their attention.

但即使这么多年来，在 Facebook 、推特、YouTube 以及其他网站上发生过那么多入侵和威胁事件，科技企业也无法摆脱对中心化的向往。Facebook 和帕兰提尔技术公司（Palantir Technologies）的投资人彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）更高度赞扬垄断行为，称之为商业的典范。内容生产型初创企业进入市场并不是为了打破 Google 或 Facebook 的垄断，而是希望被并购而成为垄断企业的一部分。新的社交网络（例如抖音）获得的新关注来自于那些对 Facebook 感到无聊的年轻用户，但这些平台仍然走的是以往的老路：在一个单一的平台上尽可能获取更多的用户，以便将用户的注意力变现。

In the process, new platforms introduce new risks too. Because it is based in China, U.S. officials fear that TikTok could be a national-security threat, used to spread disinformation or amass American citizens’ personal information. But rather than seeing the service as intrinsically threatening, as all its predecessors have been, some critics are tripping over themselves to celebrate TikTok as a charming new cultural trend. Writing at The Washington Post, Geoffrey A. Fowler compared national-security concerns about the service to xenophobia. During the Cold War, American policy responded to potential threats, even remote ones, with huge investments of money and manpower for disaster preparedness. The internet itself rose from that paranoid fog. Now we download first and ask questions later, if ever, until something goes terribly wrong—and maybe not even then.

在这个过程中，新平台也会带来新的风险。抖音的总部在中国，这导致美国官员担心它可能会成为一种国家安全威胁，被用来传播虚假信息或收集美国公民的个人信息。但是一些评论家并没有像以前一样，将抖音视为本质上的威胁，而是将它视为一种迷人的新文化趋势而大加赞赏。在《华盛顿邮报》上，杰弗里·福勒（Geoffrey A. Fowler）把对这项服务的国家安全担忧与仇外心理相提并论。在冷战期间，美国的备灾政策是通过大量的投入资金和人力，以应对潜在的（甚至是偏远的）威胁。互联网本身就是从那种偏执的迷雾中崛起的。现在，我们先下载，后提问（如果真的有问题的话），直到真的有什么东西出了大问题——也许即使那时候也不提什么问题。

The risks to online services are more numerous and varied than ever, especially now that they cater to billions of people all over the world. Somehow, the imagined consequences still seem minor—virtual real-estate or cryptocurrency grifts—even as the actual stakes are as fraught as, or worse than, they were half a century ago. The internet was invented to anticipate the aftermath of nuclear war, which thankfully never happened. But the information war that its technological progeny ignited happens every day, even if you can’t log in to Twitter to see it.

在线服务面临的风险，从数量和种类上都比以往任何时候都要多，特别是现在它们要满足全世界数十亿人的需求。不知为何，设想到的风险似乎仍然很小——不过是虚拟地产或加密货币的诈骗罢了——即使实际的风险与半个世纪前一样，甚至更糟。人们预见了核战的后果，从而发明了互联网，幸好核战争从未发生。但被互联网技术成果所点燃的信息战争则每天都在发生，即使你可能无法登录推特去看到它。
