## rAInbow （彩虹AI）

来自南非的 rAInbow 是一个聊天机器人，用户能随时通过网页或是 Facebook 私信进行咨询，告诉 rAInbow 自己身边发生的事情。

和其他聊天机器人不同，rAInbow 并不会假装自己是人类，它不会做出武断的评判或是要求，以免增加家暴受害者的心理压力。rAInbow 会针对用户的描述，给出一些如何应对的建议和指导信息，提示用户一些虐待行为即将发生的征兆，并鼓励用户向其他朋友和家庭成员求助。



此外，rAInbow 还会主动分享一些匿名的情境故事，帮助用户识别出自己和伴侣之间的关系模式（亦或者朋友、家人等）。

在这些故事中，他们可以直观地感受到自己的经历，并能和别人分享自己的理解。这些故事会和家暴相关，受害者可能听起来会很熟悉，这可以让他们了解到，他们并不是唯一经历过家庭暴力的人。即使有时会感觉孤立无援，但帮助总会在身边。


## Deevi

Deevi 是澳大利亚法律服务网站 Lawpath 利用 IBM Watson 人工智能打造的一个匿名聊天机器人。

Deevi 会向用户提出一些不含个人身份信息的问题，比如性别、年龄、受教育程度、性取向，并向用户了解你（或你认识的人）和潜在的家暴者之间的关系，以及家暴者对你（或你认识的人）做了什么事。通过对话的形式，Deevi 的 AI 会对当前的状况进行分析，帮助你做出正确的应对，并列出你可以取得帮助的方式（例如一些组织、协会，当地政府部门的求助热线等）。

最重要的一点是，Deevi 不会存储你的任何信息，包括聊天内容在内的所有信息都不会被保存。这样不会产生任何聊天记录或是网络搜索历史，也就避免了被家暴者发现产生的风险。




## HelpSelf Legal (自救法律援助)

->Documate

The HelpSelf site “interviews” users by having them answer a number of easy to understand, friendly questions that are designed to be sensitive to trauma-victims. Explanations are also provided throughout the process so that the victim can truly understand what is being asked. The questions are asked in a bite-size manner so the process doesn’t emotionally overwhelm. If it does become too overwhelming, the user can leave the system and come back to finish the interview at any time. Users can also upload evidence and screenshots throughout the process.

Once the interview is complete, the documents are ready to be e-filed, mailed or filed in person depending on the court’s requirements.

The service aims to help lawyers, not replace them.

## The Sis Bot

The Sis Bot is a chat bot that can provide 24/7 information services for survivors of violence, accessible through their mobile device or a computer. A woman facing domestic violence can for instance, message the Sis Bot via Facebook Messenger and it will immediately respond with information about how to report to the police, how to preserve evidence, and what support services or compensation they are entitled to by law. In Thailand, according to the Promotion of Family Institution Development and Protection Act, the maximum penalty for committing an act of domestic violence is up to six months imprisonment or 60,000 baht (around 1,800 USD) fine or both. The court may also order the offender to pay additional money as reparations to the survivor.

## jael.ai

jael.ai is a fully integrated real time artificial intelligence chatbot that can coordinate care for victims of domestic violence at the point of trauma. jael.ai is training to respond to men and women in dangerous situations by helping them find a safe place for themselves and their families, contact the nearest shelter, and understand the many resources that are available according to the time and location they are needing help.

jael.ai is building a national database with heavily curated information about organizations and resources for victims of domestic violence. By having direct access to the most up-to-date data jael.ai can give the most relevant help to people reaching out for assistance.

jael.ai uses natural language translation and machine learning to understand the intent of the user and turn their questions, statements, and requests into actionable intelligence.

We are using decades of knowledge from domestic violence professionals, domestic violence hotline training and law enforcement to create real time intelligence for people trapped in violent environments.



## Other AI

Verbal and emotional abuse have been found to be precursors to escalating violence, Gabrielle explained. “I wanted to see if I could develop a targeted approach to recognizing emotions from speech, and apply this to detecting potential risk of domestic violence,” she said.

Gabrielle's motivations have led her to create an algorithm, which can be used by AI assistants like Alexa or Google Home, to detect the risk for verbal and emotional abuse.

Science and technology can be harnessed to address community issues and societal problems.

“The neural network-based algorithm profiles the emotional state of a household over time through verbal interactions,” she explained. “This can provide useful information regarding potential risk for domestic violence. For instance, consistently elevated levels of anger and fear can be a red flag.”
