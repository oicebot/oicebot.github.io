## HelpSelf Legal

The HelpSelf site “interviews” users by having them answer a number of easy to understand, friendly questions that are designed to be sensitive to trauma-victims. Explanations are also provided throughout the process so that the victim can truly understand what is being asked. The questions are asked in a bite-size manner so the process doesn’t emotionally overwhelm. If it does become too overwhelming, the user can leave the system and come back to finish the interview at any time. Users can also upload evidence and screenshots throughout the process.

Once the interview is complete, the documents are ready to be e-filed, mailed or filed in person depending on the court’s requirements.

The service aims to help lawyers, not replace them.

## The Sis Bot

The Sis Bot is a chat bot that can provide 24/7 information services for survivors of violence, accessible through their mobile device or a computer. A woman facing domestic violence can for instance, message the Sis Bot via Facebook Messenger and it will immediately respond with information about how to report to the police, how to preserve evidence, and what support services or compensation they are entitled to by law. In Thailand, according to the Promotion of Family Institution Development and Protection Act, the maximum penalty for committing an act of domestic violence is up to six months imprisonment or 60,000 baht (around 1,800 USD) fine or both. The court may also order the offender to pay additional money as reparations to the survivor.

South Africa

The smart companion was developed following research and focus groups conducted by Soul City, in which it interviewed victims of domestic violence to better understand how they seek help. It can be accessed 24/7 via Facebook Messenger, and provides a safe space for domestic violence victims to access information about their rights, support options, and where they can find help – in friendly, simple language.

rAInbow also provides scenario-based stories to users, which helps them identify patterns in their own relationships or those of their friends and family members. In those patterns, they can make sense of what they’re experiencing and share their understanding with others. The stories are relatable and may sound familiar, which helps victims understand that they are not the only ones experiencing intimate partner violence and that support is available, even though, at times, it can feel like an isolating and comfortless situation.

South Africa has the highest reported rate of femicide in the world, yet domestic violence is a hidden issue due, in part, to the stigma and shame associated with it. Typically, women will suffer up to 30 incidents of abuse before they seek help.
