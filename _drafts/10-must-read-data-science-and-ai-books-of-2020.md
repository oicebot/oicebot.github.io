Becoming an expert in anything requires commitment to learn and consistency to reach your goals. The same is true for all professions whether #AI, engineering or even medical studies. Knowledge acquisition is critical in skill development as this raises your level of expertise. When was the last time you dedicated yourself to becoming an expert?

Unlike the past when **artificial intelligence** was a new concept for many, the mention of AI has become mainstream and buzzyworthy. My personal journey in the field of AI has been one filled with **consistent learning and studying with diverse resources**.

You can **become an expert in data science** today by _reading the right books_.

Here are **10 of the best books** from 2019 and 2020 in the **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Applied AI** domains for your reading list:

## 1. Interpretable Machine Learning

Author: Christoph Molnar (2019) 

![]({{site.cdn}}/img/20200304/002.jpg)

Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar focuses on **interpretability** of decisions and models of machine learning. Adoption of #machinelearning for research and product development holds great potential but the lack of predictive ability by computer systems limits the adoption of ML. The author offers a detailed analysis of **interpretable models** from linear regression, decision trees and decision rules.

Interpretation of black box models is another key area covered in the book where the author offers lessons on **LIME** and **Shapley** values for prediction purposes. Molnar dives deeper into accumulated local effects as part of agnostic methods used in AI.

**Interpretable Machine Learning** focuses on critical analysis for the **dynamics of interpretation** and how to make better choices for interpretation of machine learning.
You might ask this question: _How can I interpret my models with machine learning?_ Molnar answers this question by exploring the merits and demerits of interpretation approaches to offer readers a clear picture of the **best solutions for their projects**.

Data scientists encounter challenges interpreting their machine learning models and through **Molnar’s lesson on structured data**, you start to understand practical applications of interpretation to achieve the best results. The author keeps in mind the diverse nature of the data science industry by offering timely examples about interpretation of machine learning models.
