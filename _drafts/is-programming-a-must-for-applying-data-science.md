Do you need to be able to code in R, Python, or any other programming language to put Data Science to work for you? The answer is NO!

许多刚接触数据科学概念的同学，往往会有这样的疑问：要想用好数据科学技术，是不是我就必须学会 R、Python 或类似的什么编程语言？

剧透一下，答案是：不。

As part of the Aryng academy, I had a quick chat with Patrick, who is currently working as a sales operations team lead at a B2B service company. Of all his job responsibilities, Patrick loves the part where he gets to use data and charts using Looker and Salesforce for targeting, segmentation, and other sales strategies.

作为数据科学方面的专业咨询与培训机构—— Aryng 学院的一员，我这几天和学员 Patrick 聊了聊。目前 Patrick 领导着一家 B2B 服务企业的销售运营团队。在工作中，Patrick 喜欢使用 Looker 和 Salesforce 等工具，通过分析数据和图表，以完成定位、细分等各种销售策略。

A few months ago, he started preparing for a career in Data Science by enrolling in free courses on Udemy, Coursera, and Code Academy. He also picked up some preliminary SQL skills. Feeling that he was a bit more prepared, Patrick took [Aryng’s Analytics Aptitude Test](https://aryng.com/aryngs-analytical-aptitude-assessment/) to explore how we can help him transition to a Data Science career.

几个月前，他参加了 Udemy、Coursera 和 Code Academy 开设的免费课程，以便为踏入数据科学的职业生涯做好准备。同时，他还自学了一些 SQL 的预备知识。在觉得自己有了点准备之后，他参加了 [Aryng 的分析能力测试](https://aryng.com/aryngs-analytical-aptitude-assessment/)，我们开始探讨如何帮助他完成这一转变。

I recommended [Aryng ACCA Citizen Analyst professional certification](https://academy.aryng.com/p/business-professional-track/) to Patrick, which involves gaining basic skills in Data Science. This is done using simpler methodologies like correlation analysis leveraging BADIR, our proprietary data to decisions framework. Simple business analysis tools like Microsoft Excel is used in conjunction with BADIR framework to drive significant business impact. The ACCA program also includes working on a live project as part of the student’s workflow following the course work. We act as a mentor in the project.

我向他推荐了 Aryng 平民分析师认证课程（Aryng Certified Citizen Analyst，缩写为 ACCA），这涵盖了数据科学方面的各项基本技能。在这过程中，将会用到更为简单的方法来完成分析，例如使用 BADIR（我们专有的“数据到决策”分析框架）进行一些相关性分析等。一些简单的商业分析工具，比如微软的 Excel，可以和 BADIR 框架结合使用，并带来重大的商业效益。

在 ACCA 课程的学习过程中，学员还将完成一个真实的工作项目，作为整个课程的一部分。我们则会担任项目导师。

So, the ACCA certification doesn’t require any programming, and yet after the completion of the program, Patrick would be able to acquire skills that will help him solve 80% of the most common business problems. He can then transition to a sales analyst job if he chooses to, which could be done within his own company or even externally. Typically, as part of his new job, he would need to access aggregated ‘SMALL’ dataset via a GUI-based tool like Looker or Tableau and won’t really have to use SQL. Nonetheless, SQL is a good skill to have in your back pocket.

He can, however, choose to not end his journey here. After being ACCA certified, if he wants to go further and become a Data Scientist, he can enroll in Aryng’s Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning course. This way he would be able to leverage BADIR and use R and Python to execute regression, decision tree, text analytics, clustering, neural networks, etc. These advanced skills would help him solve the rest of 5–20% of the business problems. Typically, these advanced algorithms work with log level, event level, or customer level ‘BIG’ data and thus require programming/statistical tools to prepare the data and implement the algorithms.

In fact, we too rely a lot on using simpler methodologies. During my discussion with Patrick, I shared the same fact with him: even though we are a Data Science team fully equipped with the entire range of Data Science skills, we still often use simpler methodologies for our clients because it is often faster and is all that is needed for the project.

Patrick was surprised as well as delighted to find out that he can become a full-fledged analyst without learning to program. Moreover, if you look at Fortune 50 tech companies such as Google or Facebook, you would find that there are roles like product analysts, marketing analysts, sales analysts, etc., who fit the profile of citizen analysts. Then, they have Data Scientists or Machine Learning research teams, who fit the more advanced Data Scientist profiles we have mentioned above.

So don’t let the big hullabaloo around Data Science and more complex AI-laden algorithms lead you astray. Pick up essential citizen analyst skills, and you will know by the end of your first live project where your passion and your strength lie.

All the best.
