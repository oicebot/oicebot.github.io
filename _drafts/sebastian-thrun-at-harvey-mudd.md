The class of 2019 is entering one of the most dynamic job markets we have ever seen. According to Glassdoor, tech jobs dominated their list of the top 25 highest-paying entry-level positions. Some of the hottest tech careers include software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to name a few.  That’s why it’s so imperative for new graduates to be skilled in the jobs of today and tomorrow.

2019 届毕业生正在踏入一个前所未见的，最富有活力的就业市场。

根据 Glassdoor 的数据，入门级职位中薪资最高的 25 种职位几乎都被技术行业霸占了。这包括了软件工程师、机器学习工程师、数据科学家等等一系列最热门的技术职位。

因此，作为一名毕业新生，你必须要熟练掌握当下——以及未来——的工作所需求的技能。

As Harvey Mudd College’s 2019 commencement speaker, Sebastian Thrun shared his advice for the graduating class as they prepare to enter the job market. He encouraged the students to be curious and to believe in themselves. He stressed that one of the most rewarding qualities a student can have is to open his or her mind and to think outside of the box. He shared how these qualities helped him grow into the innovator he is today. Watch the full speech [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q84elexyyKU).

作为哈维穆德学院 2019 年毕业典礼上的演讲嘉宾，Sebastian Thrun 向正准备迈入社会的毕业生分享了他的建议。

他鼓励学生们保持好奇心，并相信自己。他强调，学生所能拥有的最有价值的品质之一，就是有着开放的思维，能够跳出框架的束缚思考问题。

他和同学们分享了自己是如何在这些品质的帮助下，一步一步成长为如今的创新者的过程。

## Believe in yourself
## 相信自己

Everything starts with a belief. Back in 2004, when Sebastian came to Stanford as a professor, the US Government launched the DARPA Grand Challenge which is an epic race for American autonomous vehicles. This was one of a kind challenge where driverless cars were expected to race on a 150-mile track across the Mojave desert. Sadly, none of the robots could finish the route. In fact, the farthest distance covered was just 11km. There were no winners declared and it was concluded that cars would never run without drivers.

一切都始于一种信念。

回到 2004 年，当 Sebastian 在斯坦福任教时，美国政府举办了 DARPA 大奖赛——这是美国自动驾驶汽车领域的史诗级竞赛。

那一年，比赛的内容是让无人驾驶汽车在莫哈韦沙漠的赛道上行驶150英里（约240千米）。然而，遗憾的是，没有任何一个机器人能跑完全程。事实上，行驶最远的一个队伍，他们的无人驾驶汽车也只不过开出了 11 公里。没有人是获胜者，看起来汽车也永远离不开人类驾驶员了。

This incident didn’t stop Sebastian from challenging his students at Stanford. He asked 20 of his students to build a driverless car that could participate in the next DARPA challenge. Surprisingly, none of these students knew what had happened during the earlier DARPA challenge. 10 months later, STANLEY––Stanford’s self-driving car––won the challenge.

但这次失败并没有阻止 Sebastian 继续带领斯坦福大学的学生面对这一挑战。

他带领 20 名学生，为参加下一次 DARPA 大奖赛建造无人车。有趣的是，这些学生中，没有人知道在之前的 DARPA 大奖赛中发生的事情。

10 个月后，斯坦福大学的自动驾驶汽车“斯坦利”赢得了比赛。

## Never give up
## 永不放弃

A few years later, Google’s co-founder Larry Page took an interest in self-driving cars and contacted Sebastian to develop one that could run on a public road in California. Sebastian declined the request, shrugging it off as impossible. There was no prior data or experience that could prove it possible. Moreover, Sebastian anticipated that in a real-world scenario, a driverless car could potentially harm people. After much persistence, Larry asked Sebastian to give him a technical reason for why a driverless car could not run on the streets of California. Sebastian couldn’t find a reason, so Google’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, was born. Within 18-months, Google’s self-driving cars were successfully tested on the streets of California.

几年以后，Google 联合创始人 Larry Page 对自动驾驶汽车产生了兴趣，他联系了 Sebastian，希望开发一种可以在城市公共道路上行驶的自动驾驶汽车。

Sebastian 认为这是个不可能完成的任务，于是拒绝了这个请求。毕竟，没有任何之前的数据或经验能证明这是可行的。此外，Sebastian 还预计，在现实世界中，无人驾驶汽车将可能会对人们造成伤害。

然而，Larry 不懈地坚持要让 Sebastian 给出技术性的理由，说明为什么无人驾驶汽车不能在加利福尼亚的街道上行驶。而 Sebastian 的努力最终催生了 Google 的自动驾驶汽车项目，也就是现在的 WayMo。在一年半之后，Google 的自动驾驶汽车真的在加利福尼亚的街道上成功地完成了测试。

## Stay curious
## 保持好奇

Curiosity is the mother of all innovation. What looks like science fiction today, could be a reality tomorrow. Had that not been the case, every innovation we’ve mastered like the telephone or electricity would have just remained science fiction. So after launching Google’s self-driving car project, Sebastian worked on many more ventures like GoogleX, Google Glass, Google Wing, Google Loon, and Google Brain before founding Udacity, the “University of Silicon Valley.” With more than [75,000 Nanodegree program](https://blog.udacity.com/2019/05/udacity-new-heights.html) graduates and over 200 industry partners, the Udacity Nanodegree program is well on its way to becoming a de-facto standard for hiring and corporate training in the tech industry.

好奇心是一切创新之母。今天看起来像是科幻小说的事物，或许明天就能变成现实。要是没有好奇心，我们如今掌握的每一项创新——比如手机、电力——或许永远都只停留在科幻之中。

因此，在 Google 的无人驾驶汽车项目启动后，Sebastian 还参与了 Google X、Google 眼镜、Wing 货运无人机、Loon 气球网络，以及 Google 大脑等项目，并最终创立了优达学城（Udacity），也就是“硅谷大学”。

拥有 75000 多名纳米学位毕业生，以及超过 200 家行业合作伙伴，如今优达学城纳米学位正在逐渐成为技术行业员工招聘和企业培训的事实标准。

If Sebastian wasn’t guided by his great curiosity, and his willingness to try the impossible, none of this would have occurred.

如果 Sebastian 没有在好奇心的指引下，愿意不懈尝试那些“不可能”的事情，那上面的这些事情都不会发生。

The Udacity program is structured with Sebastian’s story in mind, encouraging students to cultivate and grow these qualities as they explore new subjects. The constant urge to believe and learn has helped our students  gain unprecedented success. Students like Kevin Scott and Jeremy Cohen have time and time again shown unbelievable determination and trust in themselves to transform their careers in ways not seen before.

优达学城的课程正是受到 Sebastian 亲身经历的启发，鼓励学生在探索新的课程内容时，培养和发展这些品质。

持续不断的求知欲和自信心已经帮助我们的学生取得了前所未有的成就。像 Kevin Scott 和 Jeremy Cohen 这样的学生，一次又一次地表现出令人难以置信的决心和自信，并以前所未有的方式改变了自己的职业生涯。

We believe that every student has the power to change the world by creating new opportunities.  Equipped with the right skills, and a strong sense of curiosity, our graduates are prepared to flourish in the competitive world they face. We can’t wait to see what they dream up next.

我们相信，每个学生都有能力去创造新的机遇，去改变这个世界。
