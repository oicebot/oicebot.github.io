Developers of the present-day deal with more programming languages than ever before. Similarly, many IT Outsourcing Companies are now working with a huge set of languages for building all different types of software applications.

我们正处在一个编程语言大爆炸的时代。

现如今的软件开发行业，同时使用许多不同的语言，来构建各种不同类型的软件应用程序，已经是家常便饭了。

And for those harnessing these programming languages for their needs, be it personal or commercial- there are myriad options to choose from. It is further difficult for businesses to find and Hire Programmers for their Custom Software Development projects due to the diverse range of languages to choose from.

不管你是个人开发者，还是专业公司，只要是靠编程吃饭的，都逃不开选择编程语言这个问题。正如我们在往期文章中讨论过的那样，对编程语言你不能“从一而终”，有时候你甚至需要同时动用多种语言，才能方便高效地解决问题。但最终，你都必须根据实际需要——比如个人职业规划，或者公司技术栈的要求——来选择你需要使用的编程语言。

I’ve tried to find the most productive and popular programming languages for developers to learn- for those that can put the languages to practice and build something out of it.

这不是一件简单的事情。

## Top Programming Languages 2019 for developers

<img src="/img/20190829/002.gif"><br><small>
The popularity of Top Programming languages as per Google trends</small>

Before I list the top programming languages for developers, I would like to provide a brief overview of the research that went into its making. So here is a briefing of the parameters used for my research:

### 1. The highest paying top programming languages (Collected from StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019 and Indeed).

> Note: The greatness of a language isn’t determined by the developer salary packages. Similarly, it doesn’t matter how much developers are paid for a particular on-demand top programming language. What matters the most, in the long run, is how developers build their skills and work on the languages they already know.

However, I have considered this metric for the research because Salaries are if not more, but as equally important as passion.

### 2. Preferences of developers based on Surveys from StackOverflow.

Over the past decade, the development of top programming languages is being focused more on making things easier for developers. So it is only fair that their fondness towards programming languages be used as a metric here.

### 3. Analysis of developer activity on GitHub (Rankings taken from GitHut 2.0 results for Q1 2019).

While there have been no updates to the first version of GitHut since Q2 2014, GitHut 2.0 might perhaps offer similar value in terms of analyzing activity on GitHub.

### 4. Google search trends worldwide from June 2018 — May 2019.

So based on the following parameters, the top programming languages 2019 for developers came to be these:

1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. Java
4. Go
5. Elixir
6. Ruby
7. Kotlin
8. TypeScript
9. Scala
10. Clojure

## Conclusion

The world of Programming is one which keeps changing with each year. We have some top programming languages such as Java and JavaScript which have an almost eternal place in such lists. Then there are languages such as Kotlin which have risen at an astounding pace and have become one of the most in-demand programming languages to date.

As a developer, this list will give you an idea of the 10 most relevant languages of today, and perhaps motivate you to learn one of these. If you’re brave enough, then all of it! Such is the beauty of coding and computer programming in general. You have all the resources you’ll ever need to upgrade your strength, and all that matters is where you put your heart and how you put the knowledge into practice.
