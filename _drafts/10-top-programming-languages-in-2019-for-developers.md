Developers of the present-day deal with more programming languages than ever before. Similarly, many IT Outsourcing Companies are now working with a huge set of languages for building all different types of software applications.

我们正处在一个编程语言大爆炸的时代。

现如今的软件开发行业，同时使用许多不同的语言，来构建各种不同类型的软件应用程序，已经是家常便饭了。

And for those harnessing these programming languages for their needs, be it personal or commercial- there are myriad options to choose from. It is further difficult for businesses to find and Hire Programmers for their Custom Software Development projects due to the diverse range of languages to choose from.

不管你是个人开发者，还是专业公司，只要是靠编程吃饭的，都逃不开选择编程语言这个问题。正如我们在往期文章中讨论过的那样，对编程语言你不能“从一而终”，有时候你甚至需要同时动用多种语言，才能方便高效地解决问题。但最终，你都必须根据实际需要——比如个人职业规划，或者公司技术栈的要求——来选择你需要使用的编程语言。

因此，作为刚入门的新手，或者是打算再学一门语言充实一下的你，或许需要了解一下当前最热门的编程语言都有哪些。于是，下面就是我们整理的2019年顶级编程语言排行榜，希望能对你有用。

## Top Programming Languages 2019 for developers
## 2019年最好的编程语言都有哪些？

The popularity of Top Programming languages as per Google trends</small>

Before I list the top programming languages for developers, I would like to provide a brief overview of the research that went into its making. So here is a briefing of the parameters used for my research:

在正式开始之前，请容我卖点关子，介绍一下我们这个榜单是怎么统计出来的。嫌太长不想看的同学，请继续往下拉。

在本榜单统计排名的过程中，我们主要分析了以下几种因素：

### 1. The highest paying top programming languages (Collected from StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019 and Indeed).

<span class="hl">1. 这门语言的程序员的薪资等级情况</span>

这个数据来源于 StackOverflow 网站的 2019 程序员调查结果，以及 Indeed 招聘网的搜索结果。

在这里，我要先声明一下：我完全同意一门语言好不好，和程序员的工资高不高并没有什么关系。我也同意程序员的薪资水平主要是由他们的技术能力决定的。但如果你希望少走一点弯路，找到适合你的编程语言，那一门语言的开发者能拿到的薪资水平将会是一个重要的参考指标。这个指标的重要程度完全不亚于用户对这门语言的热情——毕竟热情不能当饭吃啊。

However, I have considered this metric for the research because Salaries are if not more, but as equally important as passion.

### 2. Preferences of developers based on Surveys from StackOverflow.

<span class="hl">2. 这门语言受到程序员欢迎的程度</span>

数据来源也是 StackOverflow 网站的 2019 程序员调查结果。

Over the past decade, the development of top programming languages is being focused more on making things easier for developers. So it is only fair that their fondness towards programming languages be used as a metric here.

如今的编程语言，都在向着方便程序员，提高开发效率方向发展。越优秀的编程语言，它的表达能力就越强，也就越容易受到使用者的欢迎。要想找到最好的编程语言，肯定得考虑最受用户喜欢的那些。

### 3. Analysis of developer activity on GitHub (Rankings taken from GitHut 2.0 results for Q1 2019).

<span class="hl">3. 这门语言的项目在 GitHub 上提交代码的情况</span>

数据来源是 GitHut 2.0 的 2019 年第一季度统计结果。

While there have been no updates to the first version of GitHut since Q2 2014, GitHut 2.0 might perhaps offer similar value in terms of analyzing activity on GitHub.

这个也不难理解，用这个语言写的开源项目越多，这个语言自然也越有活力。

### 4. Google search trends worldwide from June 2018 — May 2019.

<span class="hl">4. 近一年的 Google 搜索趋势</span>

数据来源是 Google 放出的全球搜索趋势数据，时间范围为 2018 年 6 月至 2019 年 5 月。

Google 趋势说明了世界各地的用户搜索的最多的是什么，能从侧面反映一个语言受到的关注情况。

## Conclusion

The world of Programming is one which keeps changing with each year. We have some top programming languages such as Java and JavaScript which have an almost eternal place in such lists. Then there are languages such as Kotlin which have risen at an astounding pace and have become one of the most in-demand programming languages to date.

As a developer, this list will give you an idea of the 10 most relevant languages of today, and perhaps motivate you to learn one of these. If you’re brave enough, then all of it! Such is the beauty of coding and computer programming in general. You have all the resources you’ll ever need to upgrade your strength, and all that matters is where you put your heart and how you put the knowledge into practice.
