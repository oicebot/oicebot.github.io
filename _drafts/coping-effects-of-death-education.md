How does a mushroom omelet, sausage links, orange juice, and a side of "being reminded that we're all mortal beings who will one day die" sound for breakfast? Great, coming right up! Ceramics artist Justin Crowe creates functional objects using the cremated ashes of loved ones to insert a little mortality into everyday life. If you're craving a cup of joe, you can have it. Literally — a coffee cup made with Grandpa Joe.




Reincarn-plate

There's no shortage of interesting ways to deal with the remains of a deceased friend or family member. Why go with a casket or cremation when you could turn a decomposing body into a tree, diamond, mushroom farm, or coral reef? Perhaps you'd rather get a tattoo of your beloved grandma, using ink mixed with your beloved grandma. Or, hell, just preserve one of her actual tattoos in a frame for your front room. Why stop there? New Mexico-based artist Justin Crowe is putting another option on the table by turning the deceased into various ceramic objects. Grief is weird.

Crowe got this maybe-morbid idea after an art project he called "Nourish." For it, he used the mixed ashes of about 200 people (bought from bone dealers who typically sell to medical professionals, students and oddity collectors) to make functional dinnerware. Crowe turned the bones into ash in a kiln, ground it up with mortar and pestle, and blended the fine ash into a liquid glaze used to coat the cups, bowls, and plates. According to his website, this series was "designed to infuse a sense of mortality into everyday moments﻿﻿﻿. [...] It's inspiration to celebrate, share, and live full while reflecting on our very existence."

After he completed "Nourish," Crowe was approached about creating custom orders for people looking to memorialize their deceased loved ones in a new and certainly unique way. And just like that, Crowe's Chronicle Cremation Designs was born. Today, you can choose from a variety of forms you'd like ashes to be transformed into: coffee mugs, candle luminaries, jewelry, and china. Instead of feeling dejected by an empty seat at your breakfast nook, you can sip your morning tea with your passed-on family member in a different way.

If the thought of heating up leftovers on Uncle Phil makes you uncomfortable, that's not something that would surprise Crowe. He notes that especially in the U.S., death is a very taboo topic that often gets swept under the rug; it's not something we want to confront on the regular. He wants to put death out in the open, if only to normalize it.

"What's been really interesting about creating ceramic objects from the ashes of passed loved ones is that it allows the owner or the person who has the pieces to interact with them," Crowe told Inverse. "It integrates them into their daily life, rather than looking at a picture on a shelf or a cremation urn on a mantle. You now have this object that is very much a part of your life."

A typical adult human body will generate between 1.8kg (4lb) and 2.7kg (6lb) of ash, and Crowe needs just 100g of it to create the custom glaze. The ash isn’t visible in the final product, but melts in the kiln to become part of the glass coating on the pottery. Crowe charges $399 to create the custom glaze plus between $159 and $649 for each pottery object.

Would the idea of going round someone’s house and drinking out of a coffee cup made from their dad not be a little creepy? “You don’t have to tell them,” Crowe said, before admitting: “It’s a really polarizing idea.”

“I’ve had people threaten me and tell me they are having me investigated. Or they’ve quoted the Bible and told me I’m going to hell. But then shortly after someone contacts me and tells me it’s a really beautiful project,” he said.

To allay critics’ concerns, he explains that the chemical composition of human ash is made up of all of the same natural materials used to create a typical ceramic glaze.

“These just happen to originate from a previously living person. It really puts into perspective that we are all just made of the same dust we walk on. It’s pretty beautiful.”

一具典型的成人尸体会产生大约 1.8 到 2.7 千克的骨灰，克罗制作定制釉料时只需要大约 100 克。在最终制作出来的器皿上其实看不到骨灰，它们在窑内烧制的过程中就已经完全熔化，成为瓷器釉面的一部分。制作这种定制釉料要收费399美金，之后每一件瓷器再加收159至649美金不等。

想想看，如果你去别人家喝杯茶，发现茶杯是对方老爸的骨灰做的，是不是会有点毛骨悚然？

死亡教育中本来就包含“尸体是有多种处理方法的”（coping with death 中包含 I am aware of the variety of options for disposing of bodies ）（见论文中的表格）

研究的结果发现接受过死亡教育的学生能在危机时刻（死亡）帮助他人度过难关

这篇论文原文是日语，只能看到英文摘要。总结一下摘要里的部分内容即可：

接受过死亡教育的人，【对自己】能消除自己对死亡的禁忌；【对他人】更知道家人临终时应做好临终护理

"Death Education" is at the same time "Life Education." For many years I have endeavored to create an awareness of the need for death education in Japan. In this paper I would like to stress the necessity of death education for the following three groups. 1. For medical personnel. Three objectives of death education: 1) Learn to understand the fears and anxieties of the patients facing death and try to reduce their excessive fears and anxieties. 2) Familiarize yourself with the ethical issues related to terminal care and try to establish a warm relationship based on trust and continue communication with the dying patient till the end. 2. For patients. 1) Be aware that the time of your life is limited and try to discover the preciousness of the remaining time. Meditate on the uniqueness of your own death. 2) Finish your unfinished business, reevaluate your human relationships and benefit from a life review therapy. 3) Remove the taboo on death, arrange your own funeral and consider the possibility of another life after death. 3. For the patient's family and friends. 1) Continue warm communication with the dying patient till the end. 2) Prepare for your own bereavement and grief. 3) Try to make your own grief process an opportunity for personal growth. When a cure is no longer possible for a dying patient, the focus of our endeavors should be loving care of the person. Death education can help us to provide better terminal care during the final stage of life.
