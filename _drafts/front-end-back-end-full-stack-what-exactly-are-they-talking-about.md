When I start looking around for information about web development I wasn’t quite sure what exactly were the skills I should have to change my career for this field. I remember that I did some job searches and all the information was overwhelming, not just for the number of abilities and languages required, but for the different of job title I found for pretty similar functions. Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack, WHAT? Of course, these are not the only ones that you are going to see when searching for jobs information. But for sure, they are the most common terms for a web developer position.

我是个半路出家的开发者。

在我真正转行之前，我也曾经一遍遍刷着招聘网站上的职位信息，看着那些 Web 开发岗位的要求，想要确定自己在这个领域还需要哪些技能。我还记得，被搜索结果中大量技术名词淹没的无助感。这可不仅仅是因为上面列出的那许许多多能力和语言，还因为我发现很多看起来差不多的职位，却有着不同的岗位名称：“前端”“后端”“全栈”，这都是啥？

当然，在搜索的过程中，你会碰到的岗位名称可远不止这些。但可以确定的一点是，这些对 Web 开发岗位来说，是最常见不过的了。

那么， 今天就让我们好好聊聊这几个岗位，也希望能为将来要进入这个领域的新手指引一下方向。

## So, why do we need to use many definitions for a developer?

## 所以，为啥要有这么多不同的岗位名称呢？

Each one of the titles is used for specific skills of the employee. The Web is growing fast and becoming more and more complex. Following that path, the job of a programmer has become more specialized in some part of the development process. It means that for each different attribute of a Web application, some specific programming languages, frameworks, or any technical expertise we have a particular job title for the developer that will execute it.

这些岗位名称，每一种都代表了应聘者/员工需要掌握的一大类特定的技术体系。

如今，网络技术的发展不断加快，复杂度也不断提高。随之而来的是，在某些开发流程中，程序员的岗位内容也变得更具专门性。换句话说，对于 Web 应用的每个不同的属性，对某些特定的编程语言、框架或是技术上的专门知识，我们都有一个专门的职位，用于描述在工作中使用这一系列技术的开发者。

For a newbie or beginner trying to find your way in the area, you need to understand what are the differences from a Front-end, Back-end, and Full-stack. To work with any of them, you will be asked for a different set of skills, however, to draw a strict line between them is not easy. Each of them has complementary skills, and yes, to execute your job as a developer better is relevant to have a good comprehension of some attributes from all three of them.

对刚入门新手，或是正在尝试在这一领域求职的人来说，你需要理解“前端”“后端”和“全栈”之间的区别，以便更好地充实自己的技术储备。对于每一种岗位，都会给求职者提出一系列的

OK, it is a lot of information. Let’s talk a little bit about what is a Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack, and how you can prepare yourself to work with it.

## Front-end Developer

<img src="/img/20190808/002.jpg">

The front-end developer is responsible for the part that you see and interact in the Web application. To make it simple, imagine that a graphic designer created a logo for a website, them a photographer was hired to take some pictures, and the writers had provided text and context for that website. The front-end is the one that takes all these separated pieces and put together making possible for us to navigate the Web pages.

For that, front-end devs have in-depth knowledge of three languages: **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**. HTML — HyperText Markup Language, is the bones of the page structure, they are required in every website that you visit. Simple like that, the HTML documents are composed by opening and closing tags to keep the document consistent. CSS — Cascading Style Sheets, is what gives a better look to the HTML. Making possible to include colors, fonts, background image. The CSS can be used to manage page elements and the way these elements are arranged on the page. And finally, the Javascript is the last piece of magic that will make all the interactions and animations, building a full Web application.

These are the primary skills if you are thinking about a career as a front-end dev, but there are not the only ones, adding to each language there are frameworks, like **Bootstrap, Semantic-UI, Foundation**. They assist with the look and usability of the application. There are the libraries: **jQuery, React, Angular**. With the code packed into a useful and straightforward way, saving time in the coding process. Include in the list **Node.js** a cross-platform environment that executes Javascript and can be used by both front and back-end devs. And even some **Ajax** technique to turn the page more dynamic and integrated with the data server for the back-end devs.

Applying these abilities, the front-end developer is a person working between the web designers and the back-end developers. They can provide analysis for the user experience, build mock-ups and wire-frames, giving recommendations for the design team. The front-end will give life, style, beauty for the construction build in the back-end.

## Back-end Developer

While the front-end devs take care of everything that you see and interact, all the backstage action is part of the back-end developers’ work. The websites that you navigate only exist because the servers are sending information to your computer or mobile device. And it’s not only that, the data that are transmitted to the webpage, forms, users account, and all personal information is stored and manipulated by the back-end team.

The back-end devs keep the servers, applications, and databases communicating and operating in a group. Because of that, they use server-side programming languages, like **PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net**, to build the robust structure of the Web applications. And others tools as **MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server** to save, change, update, and delete data from the servers. The jobs in back-end can also require some specific frameworks like **Zend, Symfony, CakePHP**, and even some experience with Linux. When looking for a job as a back-end developer is common to find in the job title the name of the primary language that the vacancy is asking for: _Ruby developers or PHP developers_. The programming language is an essential key for the job search because the application you will work with, probably, will be built in that language.

You could be thinking now, “_if the Javascript can create animation and interactions do I really need a back-end language?_”. Well, the JS had much more limitations in the past than nowadays, and it’s possible to build infinite solutions just in JS. However, there some performance issues for large and complex applications that will demand a back-end programming language. Learning different languages will make possible to you think about what is better one for distinct situations. Back-end devs need to write code that can be compatible with business strategies, translating the company necessity into the technical requirements in the most efficient architecture solution for the server and databases.

## Full-stack Developer

<img src="/img/20190808/004.jpg">

Full-stack in the developer that can deal with both, front-end and back-end part of the development for the web applications. The “stack,” in this case, is related to layers, so the developer that has skills in servers, data structuring or modeling, user interface, and user experience, encompassing all the need stages for the business is considered full-stack devs. Yes, yes, this person needs to understand the entire flow thoroughly.

But contrary from what you are thinking, the full-stack don’t necessarily mean someone that build the whole web application by itself. In the majority the cases, the full-stack dev will spend more time in the front-end or the back-end of the development process. Different from the others developers, it can cross the line during part of the project help with the user experience and modeling the database in the same job. Another common practice for the full-stack devs is that they are specialized generally in one back-end language, like Ruby full-stack developer or Python full-stack developer.

## And now, which skills should you learn?

Well, the technology field is in constant change, as you can see by the new models of phone and computers that are always pop-up. For a career in tech, the things are not different, the most used languages and frameworks may change over time, or even update their version and grammar. Learning front-end and back-end is essential to turn yourself in a versatile developer, more valuable for the changes to come.

However, whatever language you choose to focus on first, to clearly understand the details, frameworks, and libraries of the language of your choice, put you at a significant advantage in the job market. When hiring for a project, employers are looking for people with knowledge in the languages, as in the frameworks and libraries that can make the code more clean and simple, and people that can follow the application documentation.

That is it!
