My kids probably aren’t going to cure cancer. They probably aren’t going to be professional athletes or billionaire CEOs or world-famous singer-songwriters. They probably aren’t going to be the first to land on Mars or the first to climb Mount Everest while doing a handstand or even the first to read the terms and conditions all the way through.

Sure, they could do any (or all) of those extraordinary things, but chances are they won’t. Instead, they’ll most likely grow up to be ordinary adults with ordinary lives. Like me. And like you.

我的孩子们大概不会成为治愈癌症的人。他们可能并不会成为职业运动员，也不会成为身家亿万的商业巨子，更不会成为世界著名的歌手、作曲家。他们可能不会成为第一个登陆火星的人，不会成为第一个倒立着爬上珠穆朗玛峰的人，甚至不会成为第一个把协议条款读完的人。

没错，要说他们万一达成了上面这些壮举中的某一件（甚至全部），也不是完全没有可能，但更大的可能性是，他们不会成为这样的人。相反，他们很可能就这么长大，成为普通的成年人，过着普通的生活。就像你我一样。

It sounds like a horrible thing to say. How dare I shrug as my children drift toward mediocrity? I should push them harder and further and faster at the earliest possible age to reach their “full potential.” Lucky for my kids, that’s not my style. Of all the things my kids probably aren’t going to do, there’s only one I’m certain of: They aren’t going to give up their childhoods to chase “success.”

这话说出来挺可怕的。我怎么敢就这样看着自己的孩子滑向平庸的人生？我应该从他们小时候开始就更严格、更长久、更快速地逼迫他们？只要有可能，越小越好？只为了开发出他们“全部的潜力”？

我的孩子们是幸运的，这并非我的育儿之道。

在我的孩子们可能不会做的所有事情中，只有一件事是肯定的：他们肯定不会放弃自己的童年，去追逐所谓的“成功”。

At some point, the early years of many American children shifted from a time to grow and learn to a time to get on the career fast track. The road to becoming a partner at an elite East Coast law firm doesn’t start when a high school junior first thinks about colleges. It begins when their parents enroll them in violin lessons at age 5 so they’ll seem well-rounded on their Ivy League applications. The pressure is real and **well-documented**, and it begins earlier and earlier. Tiny designer briefcases as baby shower gifts can’t be too far away.

不知何时起，许多美国孩子的童年从成长学习的时光，变成了迈向职业快车道的生涯。

成为东海岸精英律师事务所的合伙人之路，并不是从高中生第一次考虑上大学时才开始的。这始于他们5岁的时候，父母为了让他们日后在申请常春藤大学时能显得多才多艺，给他们报了小提琴课。

这种压力是真实存在的，也**有着详尽的记录**，而且开始的时间越来越早。恐怕要不了多久，人们就要给刚出生的宝宝送小小的设计师公文包作礼物了。

It’s never been more apparent than now — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, when **many parents** are doing all their normal duties while also working from home and guiding their kids through online classes that work about a third of the time — that we need to take another look at our standards for success. 

It’s hard to parent, teach, and work simultaneously, even though the myth of the super-mom and -dad has taught us to expect ourselves to be all things to all people at all times. If you thought kids would take it easy on parents due to something as minor as a worldwide quarantine, you’ve never met a real-life child.

我们需要重新审视一下我们的成功标准。这从未像现在这样明显——在新冠病毒疫情期间，**许多父母**一边在家工作完成各种日常任务，一边指导孩子们完成网课学习，这些课程能占掉大约三分之一的时间。

尽管“超级父母”的神话教导我们，要让自己能在任何时候为任何人做任何事，但要在工作的同时把孩子抚养、教育好，是很不容易的。全球范围的居家隔离？你以为孩子们会因为这点小事就让父母轻松一些，恐怕你还没见识过现实生活中的人类幼崽。

Parents probably assume everybody else is still pushing their kids toward pre-pandemic standards for success, and they feel like they should be, too. The popular advice for how to do it all has no connection to reality: Set a schedule. Maintain normality. Limit screen time and get your kids hooked on books. They might as well recommend that you permanently give up sleep and grow fairy wings. 

I’ve never been a fan of limiting screen time, but now, I don’t even pretend to feel guilty when my kids finish their schoolwork and move straight to YouTube for the rest of the day. Whatever keeps them from killing each other is fine in my book. I don’t want my kids to be perfect, just alive. I was parenting apocalypse-style before it was cool.

家长们大概以为别人都还按疫情前的标准，逼着自己的孩子去追求成功，因此觉得自己也当如此。对于如何做到这一切，流行的“育儿经”给出的建议完全脱离现实：制定一个时间表，保持常态化；限制屏幕时间，让孩子们迷上书本……他们还不如建议你永久放弃睡眠，还长出仙女的翅膀呢。

我本来就不奉行限制屏幕时间的做法，而如今，当我的孩子们完成了学校的作业，然后直接把这天剩下的时间都花在视频网站上时，我甚至没有假装内疚一下。在我的“育儿经”里，只要能让他们不把彼此弄死就行。我不希望我的孩子们是完美的，只希望他们能活着。在“末日瘟疫”流行之前，我就在用这种末日风格养娃了。

I understand the culture of overachievement that got us here, even if I don’t agree with it. Growing up, my parents never put any pressure on me, but I fell in with a group of academic overachievers, and I hated to lose. As far as peer pressure goes, I could have done worse, but not by much. I was constantly stressed out as I pushed myself to succeed at everything, at least academically. 

I was valedictorian of my high school class, and I was miserable. I was valedictorian in college, too. 
(Don’t be impressed. I majored in English.)

这种“过度成就”的文化带领我们走到了现在，即使我不认同它，我也能理解它。在我成长的过程中，我父母从来没有给过我任何压力，但讨厌失败的我却落入了一群学霸当中。因为有同伴的压力，我可能做的不如别人，但也差不了多少。我不断地给自己施加压力，逼自己在每件事情上都要成功，至少在学习方面是如此。

在高中毕业典礼上，我作为优秀毕业生作了致辞，但我非常痛苦。同样，我在大学毕业的时候也作了致辞。（别觉得了不起，我的专业是英语。）

But coming out ahead in high school and college didn’t make any difference in my life, and if I didn’t bring it up as an example of what not to do, I wouldn’t even remember that it happened. And that was just me putting pressure on myself to meet the ways in which society defines success. I can’t imagine what would have happened if that pressure came from my parents. I never would have had the free time to discover and pursue my real passions, like comedy writing or taking long naps. I would have been too busy going to therapy.

但在高中和大学里拔尖，并没有给我的人生带来什么改变，如果不是我把它作为“不该做”的例子提出来，我甚至都不记得发生过这样的事情。而那只不过是我给自己施加压力，让自己符合社会对成功的定义。我无法想象如果这种压力来自于我父母，会发生什么样的事情。我恐怕永远都不会有空闲时间去发现、追求我真正热爱的东西，比如写写喜剧，打打长盹什么的。我可能会忙到需要去治疗的地步。

Today I have four young kids. I don’t want them to feel the pressure I did, from me or from themselves. I want to give them space to become their own people without pushing them toward a career path while they still have their baby teeth. That’s a weird thought in today’s world. Nobody thinks of children as having agency over their own lives. To many people, children are just a reflection of their parents’ decisions. Yet anyone who has actually spent time around kids knows that they have distinct personalities, with their own goals and preferences, pretty much from day one.

如今，我有了四个年幼的孩子。我不想让他们感受到我曾经历的那种压力，不论这压力来自于我还是他们自己。我想给他们空间，让他们成为真正的自己，而不是在他们还长着乳牙的时候，就把他们推向职业生涯。在今天的世界里，这是个奇怪的主意。没有人认为孩子能掌管他们自己的生活。在太多人看来，孩子只是其父母决定的反映。然而，任何一个真正花时间与孩子们相处过的人都知道，他们都有着独特的个性，有自己的目标和喜好——从第一天开始就是这样。

My oldest, age 9, still doesn’t play any sports (by her own choice), which is enough to get me locked up for neglect in some parts of the country. But she recently joined a robotics club she thought sounded fun, and she likes it so far. Maybe she’ll stick with it and turn it into a lifelong pursuit. Maybe she’ll drop it next year to focus on choir, or join a running club, or stand around our yard and poke things with a stick. I’m letting her explore her own interests because that’s what’s best for her. The fact that it lets me be lazy and not fly around the country for sports competitions is just a bonus.

我最大的孩子现在9岁，仍然不参加任何运动（她自己这么选择的），在国内某些地方，这就足以让我因疏于照管孩子而被关起来。但她最近加入了一个机器人俱乐部，因为她认为这听起来很有趣，而且到目前为止她都挺喜欢。也许她会坚持下去，并把它变成终生的追求。也许明年她会放弃它，开始关注合唱，或者加入跑步俱乐部，又或者站在院子里用棍子戳来戳去。我让她去探索她自己的兴趣，因为这才是最适合她的。事实上，这也对我也有额外的好处，起码我可以偷偷懒，不用为了带她参加体育比赛而在全国各地飞来飞去。

Parents today feel as though they’re letting their kids down if they don’t give them every possible advantage, no matter the cost. You might worry that if your kid doesn’t get into the best preschool, they won’t qualify for advanced classes in elementary school and junior high and high school. Then they won’t get into their (or, more likely, your) dream college, so they’ll never land that high-paying job you always wanted. You know, for them. That’s why young couples **jump on waiting lists** for “top” preschools as soon as they find out they’re pregnant. It’s never too early to start raising those math and science scores.

现在的家长们都觉得，如果没有不计成本地给孩子们提供每一种可能的有利条件，都好像是辜负了孩子。你可能会担心，如果你的孩子没有进入最好的学前班，他们就没有资格进入小学、初中和高中的重点班。然后，他们将无法进入他们（或更有可能是你自己的）梦想中的大学，所以他们将永远无法找到你一直想要的高薪工作。你懂的，为了他们。这就是为什么年轻的夫妇们一发现自己怀孕了，就开始扑向“顶级”学前教育机构的招生申请名单。现在就开始提高数学和科学课程的分数，再早也不为过，是吧。

It’s not just that parents are expected to push their kids toward success. It’s that they’re expected to push their kids toward one very specific kind of it. They feel pressured to move to expensive neighborhoods so their kids can attend “good” schools to get into “good” colleges so they can get “good” jobs. But in almost every case, “good” is just a euphemism for “well-funded” or “high-paying.” Parents who are seduced by the system expect a very measurable payout when their kids become high-powered doctors or lawyers or corporate executives, and they’re willing to pay top dollar to get them there.

这不仅是期望父母推动他们的孩子走向成功。而是期望父母能把孩子们推向一类非常具体的成功。这种压力迫使他们搬往昂贵的社区，这样他们的孩子就能上“好”的学校，考上“好”的大学，这样他们才能找到“好”的工作。但在几乎所有情况下，“好”只是“财力雄厚”或“工资很高”的委婉说法。受制度诱惑的家长们，都希望自己的孩子成为牛逼的医生、律师或企业高管，并能得到非常可观的回报，他们愿意付出高额的金钱来把孩子们推向目标。

It’s not a fair standard. Low-income people can’t afford to move a few miles down the road to a house that costs three times as much because of the school district. But those who can afford it aren’t doing themselves (or their kids) any favors, either. Kids internalize that pressure. If a family uproots itself solely so a child can have better opportunities at school, that kid better perform at the highest level — or else. Nobody triples their mortgage payments so their child can get Bs and Cs.

这个标准并不公平。低收入人群不可能因为学区的原因，搬到几英里外，三倍房价的学区房去。而那些能负担得起的人，对自己（或他们的孩子）也没有任何好处。孩子们会将这种压力内化。如果一个家庭搬家仅仅是为了让孩子在学校里有更好的机会，那这个孩子最好能有最高水平的表现。要不然……没有人会把房贷提高三倍，只为了让孩子拿到B和C的成绩。

But isn’t a focus on excellence a good thing? Not for kids. The world may be physically safer than it’s ever been (current pandemic notwithstanding), but kids today are more **depressed and anxious** than ever, and the extreme pressure to succeed can be a contributing factor. 

A 2014 review of 16 scientific studies found that burnout, which had previously been documented among professionals and university students, is **now clearly present** in high school populations, increasing the risk for anxiety and depression. 

Kids feel pressured by their parents, society, and themselves to never slip up. **Perfectionism** among students has been rising **since the 1980s**, and it doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. The result is a generation of kids on target to be equal parts wealthy and unhappy.

There’s nothing less perfect than that.

但是，专注于优秀不是一件好事吗？对孩子们来说，不是。在身体上，这个世界可能比以往都要安全（即使在疫情期间），但现在的孩子们比以往更加**压抑和焦虑**，而成功的极端压力也可能是一个诱因。

2014年一项对16项科学研究的综述认为，之前在专业人士和大学生中记录到的**倦怠情绪**，现在**明显存在于**高中生群体中，这增加了他们焦虑和抑郁的风险。

孩子们感觉到来自父母、社会和自己的压力，要求他们永远不要出错。自1980年代以来，学生中的完美主义一直在增加，而且没有任何放缓的迹象。其结果是这一代孩子中，富裕和不幸福的部分恰好相等。

这一点都不完美。

I get why parents feel pressured. Income inequality is the highest it’s been in **50 years**, and as a **new recession looms**, it can seem like winning in today’s competitive job market is the only way to feel secure. A college degree can mean a better life, so it makes sense that parents, especially those who are working- or middle-class, push their children so hard to get one. (For families that are already winning in the current economy, it seems like less of a necessity and more like running up the score.) But regardless of a household’s income level, the negative effects of academic pressure are the same. Pushing kids too hard too early can hold them back in ways that never show up on a standardized test score. More and more, “excellent” and “damaged” go hand-in-hand.

我明白为什么父母们会有压力。收入贫富不均是近**50年**来最高的，而随着**新一轮经济衰退逐渐逼近**，似乎只有在竞争激烈的就业市场上获胜才会有安全感。一个大学学位可能意味着更好的生活，所以很自然地，父母们——尤其是那些工薪阶层或中产阶级的父母们——就会拼命迫使自己的孩子取得一个学位。对于在当前经济形势下已经胜券在握的家庭来说，这似乎没那么紧要，更像是镀一镀金，增加个人价值。但无论一个家庭的收入水平如何，学业压力的负面影响都是一样的。过早地把孩子们逼得太紧，会对他们的成长产生遏制，而这种负面影响永远无法从标准化考试成绩上表现出来。“优秀”和“伤害”携手同行的状况，只会越来越多。

Am I really saying you shouldn’t do everything in your power to make sure your child makes as much money as possible one day? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Take a deep breath. I have only three goals for my own kids, none of which have anything to do with becoming the richest people in the world. I’ll consider my kids to be successful adults someday if: 1) they can support themselves, 2) they’re not serial killers, and 3) they don’t blame me for all of their problems. There are so many other perfectly good scapegoats in the world. I just want them to leave me out of it.

“什么，这家伙说，我不应该想尽一切办法让我的孩子有一天能赚到尽可能多的钱？”是的，我就是这个意思。

放松，深呼吸。我对自己的孩子只有三个目标，这些目标与“成为世界上最富有的人”一点关系也没有。只要满足这三个目标，我就会认为我的孩子们已经成为成功的成年人：1）他们能养活自己，2）他们不是连环杀手，3）他们不把自己所有的问题都归咎于我。这个世界上已经有那么多非常好的替罪羊了，我只希望他们别把我算上。

Ultimately, you can’t control your kid’s future, whether you take a laid-back approach to parenting or read SAT prep questions to them in utero. What you can do is give your child the mental and emotional tools to not define themselves by their test scores or salary. The greatest thing you can teach your kid is how to find meaning and fulfillment on their own. Kids who grow up understanding that are the ones who really come out ahead in life, regardless of their class rank or tax bracket.

归根结底，不管你是采取放松悠闲的育儿方式，还是在子宫里就给他们读SAT预习题，你都无法控制孩子的未来。你能做的是给孩子提供心理和情感上的工具，让他们不再用考试成绩或薪资水平来定义自己。你能教给孩子的最伟大的东西，就是如何去寻找自己的意义和成就感。无论他们的成绩档次或税率等级如何，只有在成长过程中明白这一点的孩子，才真正能在生活中脱颖而出。

Recently, I took my 9-year-old to the park and taught her to play wiffle ball. We made it through all nine innings and had a great time together, even if it was a little cold and windy to be out. Nothing we did that day will lead down a road that will impress a college recruiter. Not everything has to be an organized sport or competition with the possibility of a scholarship dangling at the end. My dream for my oldest daughter isn’t for her to attend a top school that lands her a prestigious 80-hour-a-week job and puts her in the top 1 percent. It’s for her to one day have the free time to play wiffle ball with her own kids, if she decides to have them. There’s nothing mediocre about a life like that.

最近，我带着我9岁的孩子去公园，教她打威浮球。虽然在外面有点冷，也起了点风，但我们还是打完了九个回合，一起玩得很开心。那天我们所做的一切，都不会给高校招生办留下什么深刻印象。并非所有的事情都得是有组织的运动或比赛，最后可能还得跟奖学金挂上钩。我对大女儿的梦想并不是让她上一所名校，以便她能找到一份牛逼闪闪的996工作，进入什么行业顶尖的百分之一。我的梦想是希望她有一天也能有空闲时间和自己的孩子们一起打球，如果她决定要孩子的话。这样的生活一点也不平庸。

I don’t actually think I’m raising mediocre children. In fact, my kids might even be above average, which is what every parent thinks about their offspring. But I’ll never burden them with unrealistic expectations to become the smartest, richest, most famous, or whatever else is considered #goals on Instagram this week. I want my kids to be happy and healthy, with the freedom to pursue their passions.

我并不真的认为我在养育平庸的孩子。事实上，我的孩子们甚至可能高于平均水平，这也是每个父母对自己后代的想法。但我不会让他们担负不切实际的期望，比如成为最聪明、最富有、最有名的人，或者其他什么在本周上榜的所谓人生目标。我希望我的孩子们能够快乐、健康，能自由地追寻自己热爱的事物。

That might seem ordinary to some, but to me, it’s the most extraordinary kind of life.

这也许在有些人看来很普通，但对我来说，那样的生活才最不平凡。
