From inside her living room in London, Paula Koelemeijer can feel the world around her growing quieter.

宝拉·科勒伊梅尔（Paula Koelemeijer）坐在她伦敦家中的起居室里，感觉到周边的世界正变得越来越安静。

Koelemeijer, a seismologist, has a miniature seismometer sitting on a concrete slab at the base of her first-floor fireplace. The apparatus, though smaller than a box of tissues, can sense all kinds of movement, from the rattle of trains on the tracks near Koelemeijer’s home to the waves of earthquakes rolling in from afar. Since the United Kingdom announced stricter social-distancing rules last month, telling residents not to leave their home except for essential reasons, the seismometer has registered a sharp decrease in the vibrations produced by human activity.

作为一名地震学家，科勒伊梅尔家一层壁炉的混凝土底板上放着一台微型地震仪。这个设备虽然还没有一包抽纸大，却能探测到各种各样的振动：不论是列车在附近铁轨上驶过时的嘎嘎作响，还是远处传来的地震波，都能被精确地记录下来。

上个月英国政府颁布了更严格的保持社交距离规定，要求居民无必要原因不得离家。在此之后的地震仪记录中，人类活动造成的振动出现了一个明显的下降。

With fewer trains, buses, and people pounding the pavement, the usual hum of public life has vanished, and so has its dependable rhythms: Before the spread of COVID-19 shut down the city, Koelemeijer could plot the seismometer’s data and see the train schedule reflected in the spikes, down to the minute. Now, with fewer trains running, the spikes seem to come at random.

随着列车、公交甚至人行道上行人的减少，平时公共活动产生的嗡嗡声消失了，这些振动的规律性也随之而去：在这座城市因新冠肺炎影响而关闭之前，科勒伊梅尔能从地震仪数据图上看到那些尖峰反映出的列车时间表，甚至精确到分钟。而如今，随着列车的减少，那些尖峰看起来更加随机了。

“It’s very literally reflecting a slowdown of our lives,” Koelemeijer told me over Skype.

科勒伊梅尔通过网络聊天软件告诉我：“这非常真实地反映出，我们的生活正在减速。”

Koelemeijer said she briefly geeked out over the recent data before reality set in. At first glance, this is indeed a fascinating observation, the kind of factoid that might appear on the underside of a Snapple cap. The “wow” moment is short-lived, of course, because the explanation is not a quirk of nature or some other benign eccentricity, but a catastrophic virus that has sickened and killed thousands, crumpled economies, and plunged public life into a fearful limbo with no easily discernible end.

科勒伊梅尔表示，她在真正开始之前，只是简略地对着最近的数据开了下脑洞。一眼看去，这一观察结果确实令人着迷，就像是你在 Snapple 饮料瓶盖里看到的那些“趣味小知识”一样的东西。

当然，最初的惊叹是短暂的，因为这现象背后的解释并不是什么神奇的自然原因，也不是其他无害的怪事，而是一种灾难性的病毒。这病毒感染并杀死了成千上万的人，使经济瘫痪，让公共生活陷入望不到头的可怕困境之中。

But the response to the pandemic has unwittingly produced some other large-scale, though less conspicuous, effects. In a bittersweet twist, the surreal slowdown of life as we know it has presented researchers with a rare opportunity to study the modern world under some truly bizarre conditions, and they’re scrambling to collect as much data as they can. Here are four ways the pandemic is being felt across land, air, and sea.

但这种疫情应对措施无意中产生了一些其他的影响，这些影响从尺度上看相当大，却并不那么引人注目。我们所知的这种超现实的“生活减速现象”正在以一种苦乐参半的方式，为研究者们提供了能够在某些真正离奇的条件下研究现代世界的难得机会，而他们正艰难地收集尽可能多的数据。

下面是从四种不同途径中感受到的疫情对大地、天空与海洋产生的影响。

## 地表振动减少 THERE’S LESS RUMBLING ON THE SURFACE

Seismologists around the world have noticed the same effect Koelemeijer detected in London, and at more traditional stations than a fireplace.

科勒伊梅尔在伦敦的发现并不是孤例，世界各地的地震学家都注意到类似的现象——当然用的是更加传统的监测站，而不是壁炉。

The trend started with Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, in Brussels. Seismic stations are usually found well outside metropolitan areas, away from vibrations that could obscure subtle tremors within Earth’s interior, but the Brussels station was established more than a century ago, before a city grew around it. Today, it provides a fascinating glimpse of the ebb and flow of a bustling city; Lecocq has found that when it snows, anthropogenic seismic activity decreases, and on the day of a road race, it spikes. Lecocq checked seismic data the day before Belgium began a nationwide lockdown, and then the following morning. The drop in activity, he said, was “immediate.” Right now, daytime in Brussels resembles Christmas Day.

最早提出这一趋势的是托马斯·莱科克（Thomas Lecocq），他在布鲁塞尔工作，是比利时皇家天文台的一名地震学家。地震监测站通常都建立在远离大城市的地方，但布鲁塞尔站是在一百多年前建设的，早在城市增长并把它包裹其中之前。如今，它提供了如此迷人的缩影，让人得以一瞥繁华都市的潮起潮落；莱科克发现，在下雪时，人类行为造成的地面振动减少，而在道路比赛的日子，地震仪的波形就满是尖峰。莱科克查看了比利时进入全国性封锁状态前一天的地震波数据，并和之后那天早晨的数据进行了对比。他表示活动的降低情况简直是“立竿见影”。如今，白天的布鲁塞尔就像圣诞节期间一样安静。

Lecocq shared his approach online, and seismologists in the United States, France, New Zealand, and elsewhere are now seeing the effects of their country’s own social-distancing measures on seismic activity. For seismologists who study seismic signals from Earth’s interior—rather than other sources, including people, animals, even storms—quarantines seem to have made it easier to listen. “Normally we wouldn’t pick up a 5.5 [magnitude earthquake] from the other side of the world, because it would be too noisy, but with less noise, our instrument is now able to pick up 5.5’s with much nicer signals during the day,” Koelemeijer said.

莱科克在网络上分享了他的方法，于是美国、法国、新西兰以及其他地方的地震学家们都开始利用地震活动观测本国的社交隔离情况。对于研究来自地球内部的地震信号——而不是其他来源，比如人为、动物甚至风暴等——的科学家来说，隔离似乎让信号更容易被接收到。“通常情况下，我们基本上检测不到来自地球另一端的5.5级（地震），因为环境实在是太嘈杂了。但随着噪音的减少，现在我们的仪器在白天也能捕获到很不错的信号。”科勒伊梅尔表示。

## 大气污染减少 THERE’S LESS AIR POLLUTION
As cities and, in some cases, entire nations weather the pandemic under lockdown, Earth-observing satellites have detected a significant decrease in the concentration of a common air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, which enters the atmosphere through emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and power plants. The drop, observed in China and Europe, coincided with stringent social-distancing measures on the ground. Air pollution can seriously damage human health, and the World Health Organization estimates that conditions stemming from exposure to ambient pollution—including stroke, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses—kill about 4.2 million people a year.

正当许多城市——有些情况下是整个国家——在封锁下经受着疫情影响时，地球观测卫星检测到常见空气污染物二氧化氮的浓度在显著降低。而二氧化氮来自汽车、卡车、公交车以及发电厂的废气排放。在中国和欧洲观察到的污染物降低与地面实行的严格社交隔离措施相吻合。空气污染会严重损害人类健康，世界卫生组织（WHO）估计，由于暴露在环境污染中而产生的疾病（包括中风，心脏病和呼吸系统疾病）每年造成约420万人死亡。

The cleaner air could lead to a brief respite in parts of the world with severe air pollution even as they battle the coronavirus. According to an analysis by Marshall Burke, a professor in Stanford’s Earth-system science department, a pandemic-related reduction in particulate matter in the atmosphere—the deadliest form of air pollution—likely saved the lives of 4,000 young children and 73,000 elderly adults in China over two months this year.

更干净的空气也能给那些空气污染严重的地区带来一丝喘息的机会，即使在与冠状病毒的斗争中也是如此。根据斯坦福地球系统科学系教授马歇尔·伯克（Marshall Burke）的分析，今年这两个月里，最致命的空气污染物——大气颗粒物因疫情影响而减少排放，可能挽救了中国4000名幼儿与73000名老人的生命。

“There’s a quantifiable temporary benefit,” Joseph Majkut, the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, in Washington, D.C., told me, referring to Burke’s analysis. But—and it’s an important “but”—“as we go about our recovery, I think we’ll go back to business as usual,” he said. A drop in emissions this year, including carbon dioxide, the pollutant that causes global warming, won’t make a dent in the long-term effort to manage the climate crisis. “We’re not solving climate change by having a global pandemic,” Majkut said.

“确实存在可量化的临时性收益”华盛顿哥伦比亚特区尼斯卡宁中心的气候政策主管约瑟夫·麦可特（Joseph Majkut）在谈及伯克的分析时表示。但是——请注意这个“但是”很重要——“随着我们逐步进入恢复阶段，我认为我们还是会回到原来的老路上去”，他说。因为疫情，今年的污染物排放确实有所减少（包括造成全球变暖的二氧化碳等大气污染物），但这并不能减轻应对气候危机需付出的长期努力。“我们不能指望来一场全球性的瘟疫就能解决气候变化问题。”他强调。

## 城市声环境改变 CITY SOUNDSCAPES ARE CHANGING
With so many people staying home—and public-transit agencies cutting service as a result—there’s significantly less noise from cars, buses, trains, and other transportation. Erica Walker, a public-health researcher at Boston University, has taken a decibel meter with her on her socially distanced walks, and she has been stunned by the measurements. “It’s a lot quieter,” she told me.

如此之多的人都待在家里，而公共运输企业也随之削减服务，这就导致城市中汽车、公交、铁路等各种交通运输过程产生的噪音显著下降。波士顿大学公共健康研究员艾瑞卡·沃克（Erica Walker）在社交隔离期间出行时随身携带了一只分贝计，用于测量环境噪声强度。测量的结果使她十分震惊。“安静得可多了”，她表示。

Before the coronavirus pandemic, the acoustic environment in Kenmore Square, a busy intersection near campus, is usually about 90 decibels during rush hour. Yesterday, Walker’s rush-hour readings were just under 68 decibels. (For comparison, a subway train rumbling past nearby registers at 95 decibels—the level at which chronic exposure could result in impaired hearing—and the sound of normal conversation is 60 to 70 decibels.) In some spots in the Fenway Park area, where Walker has studied noise pollution for several years through her program Noise and the City, her latest data show reductions close to 30 decibels. “It’s unbelievably a huge difference,” Walker said.

大学校园附近有一处繁忙的十字路口——肯莫尔广场（Kenmore Square）。在新冠疫情爆发之前，这里的声环境水平在高峰时段能达到90分贝。昨天沃克在高峰时间测量这里的噪音值则只有68分贝。（作为对比，一列地铁驶过附近的记录器时读取到的噪音大约是95分贝，长期暴露在这一水平的噪音下可能会导致听力损害。而普通的谈话音量大约是60到70分贝。）沃克曾经通过一个名为“噪音与城市”的程序，在芬威球场（Fenway Park）进行过噪声污染研究，而如今在球场区域中的某些地方，最新的数据显示这里的声音降低到接近30分贝的程度。沃克称，“这真是令人难以置信的巨大差别”。

City dwellers might now be hearing sounds that can get muffled by the usual drone. Rebecca Franks, an American who lives in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China, made this observation 48 days into the city’s quarantine last month: “I used to think there weren’t really birds in Wuhan, because you rarely saw them and never heard them. I now know they were just muted and crowded out by the traffic and people,” Franks wrote on Facebook. “All day long now I hear birds singing. It stops me in my tracks to hear the sound of their wings.” Sylvia Poggioli, an NPR correspondent in Italy, reported that the streets of Rome are so empty, “you can actually hear the squeak of rusty door hinges,” and “the chirping of birds, an early sign of spring, is almost too loud.”

城市居民如今或许能听到以往被噪音盖过的许多声音。住在疫情爆发中心武汉的美国人瑞贝卡·弗兰克斯（Rebecca Franks）在城市隔离期间进行了48天的观察，直到上个月：“我曾认为，武汉并没有什么鸟类，因为你基本上很难见到鸟儿，也从没听到它们的声音。如今我才知道，它们只是被车辆和人群发出的声音掩盖、挤占了。”弗兰克斯在社交媒体上写道，“如今一整天我都能听到鸟儿在歌唱，我停下脚步倾听它们振翅的声音。”美国全国公共广播电台（NPR）在意大利的通讯记者西尔维亚·波吉欧里（Sylvia Poggioli）报道称，罗马的街道如此空旷，“你甚至能听到生锈门扇的嘎吱声”，而且“那鸟儿的鸣叫声——春天来临的征兆——听起来都有点太响亮了。”

A quick search for the phrase birds are louder on Twitter reveals that many other people have been wondering the same thing I have lately: Are the birds chirping more fiercely these days, or am I losing my mind? With spring migration in full swing in the Northern Hemisphere, there are certainly more birds around. But the reduction in noise pollution—and, in some places, its total absence—might make it easier to notice the usual trilling and squawking.

在社交媒体上简单地搜索了一下“鸟叫声更响了”这个短语之后，我发现许多人也抱有和我最近一样的疑虑：是这几天的鸟叫声特别大声呢，还是我快疯了？随着北半球春季迁徙达到高潮，周围的鸟类肯定更多了。但随着噪声污染的降低（甚至在某些地方完全消失），可能使人们更容易注意到鸟儿通常发出的那些颤音和尖叫。

Quieter conditions, perhaps for several months, might seem like a good thing; it’s well established that noise pollution can negatively affect our health, contributing to stress-related ailments, high blood pressure, sleep disruption, and other problems. Any potential benefits are difficult to predict without more research, Walker said, and based on recent activity in the Noise and the City’s app, where Bostonians can record neighborhood sounds and provide their own descriptions, people might respond to newfound quiet in different ways. For some residents, the new soundscape reminds them of the peacefulness of their childhood decades ago, when the city was less built up. For others, it’s another source of pandemic-related stress—eerie, like the calm before a storm.

或许会持续好几个月的安静状态，看起来可能是件好事：众所周知，噪音污染会对我们的健康造成负面影响，导致与压力有关的疾病，高血压，睡眠紊乱以及其他问题。沃克认为，在缺乏进一步研究的情况下，很难预测还有哪些潜在的益处；而基于“噪音与城市”软件最近的活动（波士顿居民能用它录下周边的声音，并写上自己的描述），人们可能对新发现的安静状态有不同的反应。对于一些居民来说，新的声环境让他们想起了几十年前，自己孩提时的宁静——那时城市尚未发展到现在的规模。对于其他人，这可能是另外一种和疫情相关的怪异压力——就像风暴来临前的平静一般。

## 海洋大概也变得更加安静 THE OCEANS ARE PROBABLY QUIETER, TOO
For other species, less noise pollution is no doubt welcome. Michelle Fournet, a marine ecologist at Cornell who studies acoustic environments, is hoping to position underwater microphones off the coast of Alaska and Florida, where she has studied humpback whales and other marine life, to investigate how the waters have changed in the absence of noise from cruise ships as the industry suspends operations worldwide.

对于其他物种来说，噪声污染的减少无疑是件好事。康奈尔大学研究声环境的海洋生态学家米歇尔·富尔内（Michelle Fournet）在阿拉斯加和佛罗里达沿海研究座头鲸和其他海洋生物，她希望将水下麦克风安置在沿岸一带，以研究在没有游轮噪音干扰的情况下（这一行业目前在全球范围内暂停运营），研究这些水域的变化。

“Just pulling those cruise ships out of the water is going to reduce the amount of global ocean noise almost instantaneously,” Fournet told me. “We’re experiencing an unprecedented pause in ocean noise that probably hasn’t been experienced in decades.”

“只不过是把这些游船都拉出水面，全球海洋噪音的数量几乎立刻就减少了”，富尔内表示，“我们正在经历一场史无前例的海洋噪音暂停现象，这大约是过去几十年都未经历过的。”

Research has shown that ambient noise from ships and other maritime traffic can increase stress-hormone levels in marine creatures, which can affect their reproductive success. Whales have even shown they can adapt to the din, pausing their singing when cargo ships are near and resuming when they move away.

研究表明，来自船只和其他海上交通工具的外部噪音会增加海洋生物的压力激素水平，从而影响它们的成功繁殖。鲸类甚至显示出适应嘈杂声的能力，在货船接近时它们会暂停歌唱，等船开走后再继续。

The unexpected ecological moment brought on by the pandemic reminds Fournet of an accidental experiment that unfolded in the days after 9/11, when ship traffic in North American waters ground to a halt. Researchers working in Canada’s Bay of Fundy—already making recordings and taking samples before the terrorist attacks—eventually found that over the course of just a few days, when the noisy waters calmed, right whales in the bay experienced a drop in their stress-level hormones.

疫情带来的这次意想不到的生态学契机，让富尔内想起了“9·11”后进行的一场偶然实验。当时，北美水域的船只全面停驶。在加拿大芬迪湾工作的研究人员最后发现（他们在恐怖袭击之前就已经进行了录音和取样工作），在短短的几天过程中，当喧闹的水域平静下来时，湾区内露脊鲸的压力激素水平就有所降低了。

Fournet is thinking now of North Pacific humpback whales, who have begun to move northward this month and will soon be swimming with newborn calves in southeast Alaska, a region also popular with cruise ships for views of local wildlife. “This will be the quietest entry that humpback whales have had in southeastern Alaska in decades,” Fournet said. “Nature is taking a breath when the rest of us are holding ours.”

富尔内如今正在考虑的是北太平洋的座头鲸，本月它们正往北迁徙，不久后将会带着新生的幼鲸在阿拉斯加东南海域游弋。但这一区域同时也备受游轮的欢迎，因为在这里可以欣赏到当地的野生动植物景观。“这将是几十年来座头鲸们进入阿拉斯加东南部时最安静的时候”，富尔内表示，“当我们剩下这些人屏住呼吸时，大自然就松了一口气吧。”
